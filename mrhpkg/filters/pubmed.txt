TI  - Effects of breast stimulation for spontaneous onset of labor on salivary oxytocin
      levels in low-risk pregnant women: A feasibility study.
PG  - e0192757
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0192757 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This preliminary study aimed to 1) determine changes in the salivary 
      oxytocin (OT) level during breast stimulation for promoting the spontaneous onset
      of labor in low-risk term pregnancies, and 2) clarify the feasibility of the
      breast stimulation intervention protocol in terms of practicality and
      acceptability. METHODS: We used a single arm trial design. Sixteen low-risk
      pregnant women between 38 and 40 weeks of gestation with cephalic presentation
      participated. They performed breast stimulation for 3 days with an attendant
      midwife in a single maternity hospital. Each breast was stimulated for 15 minutes
      for a total of 1 hour per day. Saliva was collected 10 minutes before the
      intervention and 15, 30, 60, 75, and 90 minutes after the intervention, yielding 
      18 samples per woman. RESULTS: Among a total of 282 saliva samples from the 16
      participants, OT level was measured in 142 samples (missing rate: 49.6%). The
      median OT level showed the highest values on day 3 of the breast stimulation,
      with a marked increase 30 min after the intervention. In the mixed models after
      multiple imputation for missing data, the OT level on the first day of
      intervention was significantly lower than that on the third day of intervention. 
      Fatigue from breast stimulation decreased on subsequent days, and most of the
      women (75%) felt no discomfort with the protocol. Uterine hyperstimulation was
      not observed. CONCLUSION: Following a 3-day breast stimulation protocol for
      spontaneous onset of labor, the mean OT level showed the highest values on day 3.
      The breast stimulation intervention protocol showed good feasibility in terms of 
      practicality and acceptability among the pregnant women. Additional large-scale
      studies are warranted to confirm the protocol's effectiveness.

TI  - Human Milk H2O2 content: Does it benefit preterm infants?
LID - 10.1038/pr.2017.303 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human milk has a high content of the antimicrobial compound hydrogen 
      peroxide (H2O2). As opposed to healthy full-term infants, preterm neonates are
      fed previously expressed and stored maternal milk. These practices may favor H2O2
      decomposition, thus limiting its potential benefit to preterm infants. The goal
      of this study was to evaluate the factors responsible for H2O2 generation and
      degradation in breastmilk. METHODS: Human donors' and rat milk, along with rat
      mammary tissue were evaluated. The role of oxytocin and xanthine oxidase on H2O2 
      generation, its pH-dependent stability, as well as its degradation via
      lactoperoxidase and catalase were measured in milk. RESULTS: Breast tissue
      xanthine oxidase is responsible for the H2O2 generation and its milk content is
      dependent on oxytocin stimulation. Stability of the human milk H2O2 content is pH
      dependent and greatest in the acidic range. Complete H2O2 degradation occurs when
      human milk is maintained, longer than 10 min, at room temperature and this
      process is suppressed by lactoperoxidase and catalase inhibition. CONCLUSIONS:
      Fresh breastmilk H2O2 content is labile and quickly degrades at room temperature.
      Further investigation on breastmilk handling techniques to preserve its H2O2
      content, when gavage-fed to preterm infants is warranted.Pediatric Research

TI  - Oxytocin mediates the beneficial effects of the exercise training on breast
      cancer.
PG  - 222-235
LID - 10.1113/EP086463 [doi]
AB  - NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? We hypothesized that
      potential anti-tumour effects of exercise training might be mediated by oxytocin 
      and explored the underlying mechanisms in a mouse model of breast cancer. What is
      the main finding and its importance? Interval exercise training, by inducing
      oxytocin secretion, may reduce the activity of the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways, and
      consequently, results in a smaller tumour volume in a mouse model of breast
      cancer. Exercise training can affect the growth of breast tumours. We
      hypothesized that exercise training might reduce breast tumour growth by inducing
      oxytocin (OT) secretion and its related signalling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt and
      ERK. Therefore, 56 BALB/c mice were equally divided into seven groups to study
      the effects of OT and atosiban (an oxytocin receptor antagonist) together with
      interval exercise training on mammary tumour growth, as well as tumour-related
      signalling pathways, including PI3K/Akt and ERK. Animal weight, OT plasma
      concentration, tumour weight and volume were measured at the end of the study.
      PI3K/Akt and ERK were evaluated by Western blot and qPCR assays. The results
      showed that OT plasma concentration was significantly increased in trained
      animals. The volume and weight of tumours were decreased significantly after both
      exercise training and OT administration. The expression of genes involved in
      tumour cell proliferation, such as PI3KR2, Akt and mTOR, was notably lower in the
      exercise-trained and OT-treated groups. Furthermore, the expression of genes
      involved in cell apoptosis, such as caspase-3 and Bax, was significantly
      increased in the tumour tissues. In addition, Western blot results showed that
      phosphorylated Akt and ERK were significantly decreased in the exercise training 
      and OT groups compared with the tumour group. Interestingly, atosiban reversed
      these effects. These results indicated that interval exercise training, acting
      via OT secretion, may reduce PI3K/Akt and ERK axis activities, and consequently, 
      decrease tumour volume and weight in a mouse model of breast cancer.

TI  - Associations Between Postpartum Depression, Breastfeeding, and Oxytocin Levels in
      Latina Mothers.
PG  - 436-442
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2016.0213 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD), often comorbid with anxiety, is the
      leading medical complication among new mothers. Latinas have elevated risk of
      PPD, which has been associated with early breastfeeding cessation. Lower plasma
      oxytocin (OT) levels have also been associated with PPD in non-Latinas. This
      pilot study explores associations between PPD, anxiety, breastfeeding, and OT in 
      Latinas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four Latinas were enrolled during their
      third trimester of pregnancy and followed through 8 weeks postpartum. Demographic
      data were collected at enrollment. Depression was assessed using the Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at each time point (third trimester of
      pregnancy, 4 and 8 weeks postpartum). The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI) was administered postpartum and EPDS anxiety subscale was used
      to assess anxiety at each time point. Breastfeeding status was assessed at 4 and 
      8 weeks postpartum. At 8 weeks, OT was collected before, during, and after a
      10-minute breast/bottle feeding session from 28 women who completed the
      procedures. Descriptive statistics are provided and comparisons by mood and
      breastfeeding status were conducted. Analyses of variance were used to explore
      associations between PPD, anxiety, breastfeeding status, and OT. RESULTS: Just
      under one-third of women were depressed at enrollment. Prenatal depression, PPD, 
      and anxiety were significantly associated with early breastfeeding cessation
      (i.e., stopped breastfeeding before 2 months) (p < 0.05). There was a significant
      interaction between early breastfeeding cessation and depression status on OT at 
      8 weeks postpartum (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of OT were observed in
      women who had PPD at 8 weeks and who had stopped breastfeeding their infant by 8 
      weeks postpartum. Future studies should investigate the short- and long-term
      effects of lower OT levels and early breastfeeding cessation on maternal and
      child well-being.

AB  - Speculation that the release of oxytocin by orgasm in the human female during
      coitus facilitates fertility by enhancing uterine sperm transport has been
      criticized as having no unequivocal empirical human evidence. However, a counter 
      claim that this supports human "exceptionalism" as some form of uterine sperm
      transport occurs in other species. This is a misconception as it ignores that
      human uterine peristalsis, powered by contractions of the smooth muscle of the
      archimyometrium, facilitates sperm transport even without any systemic oxytocin
      involvement. Moreover, examination of various unique reproductive mechanisms in
      numerous animals also indicates that the claim is misjudged and rests on a biased
      interpretation of what "exceptionalism" means in this biological context. Ten
      chosen aspects of our sexuality are presented as being exceptional to humans.

TI  - A genome-wide association study reveals candidate genes for the supernumerary
      nipple phenotype in sheep (Ovis aries).
PG  - 570-579
LID - 10.1111/age.12575 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely applied in livestock to 
      identify genes associated with traits of economic interest. Here, we conducted
      the first GWAS of the supernumerary nipple phenotype in Wadi sheep, a native
      Chinese sheep breed, based on Ovine Infinium HD SNP BeadChip genotypes in a total
      of 144 ewes (75 cases with four teats, including two normal and two supernumerary
      teats, and 69 control cases with two teats). We detected 63 significant SNPs at
      the chromosome-wise threshold. Additionally, one candidate region (chr1:
      170.723-170.734 Mb) was identified by haplotype-based association tests, with one
      SNP (rs413490006) surrounding functional genes BBX and CD47 on chromosome 1 being
      commonly identified as significant by the two mentioned analyses. Moreover, Gene 
      Ontology enrichment for the significant SNPs identified by the GWAS analysis was 
      functionally clustered into the categories of receptor activity and synaptic
      membrane. In addition, pathway mapping revealed four promising pathways (Wnt,
      oxytocin, MAPK and axon guidance) involved in the development of the
      supernumerary nipple phenotype. Our results provide novel and important insights 
      into the genetic mechanisms underlying the phenotype of supernumerary nipples in 
      mammals, including humans. These findings may be useful for future breeding and
      genetics in sheep and other livestock.

AB  - A 37-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with severe headache,
      which quickly progressed to altered mental status and seizure activity in
      hospital. Her initial serum sodium concentration ([Na]) was 126 mmol/L. In the 24
      hours before admission, she exercised vigorously for 120 minutes (interval
      training plus yoga) and also consumed more than 4 liters of fluid during that
      time to both stay hydrated and facilitate milk production because she was
      actively nursing 2 children. Her serum [Na] and altered mental status corrected
      slowly over the next 48 hours with furosemide, hypertonic saline, and fluid
      restriction. This case is unique because it discusses the possible pathogenic
      role that lactation-induced oxytocin release may have on sustained antidiuresis
      and dilutional exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). This would be the first
      report documenting EAH in a lactating woman, which may highlight an
      underrecognized risk factor for physically active women who are concurrently
      breast-feeding.

TI  - The Relationship of the Administration of Intrapartum Synthetic Oxytocin and
      Breastfeeding Initiation and Duration Rates.
PG  - 98-102
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2016.0185 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The consequences that intrapartum administration of hormones can have on
      breastfeeding are unclear. The aim of the study is to determine if synthetic
      intrapartum oxytocin, used routinely for induction/stimulation, has a
      relationship to initiation/duration of breastfeeding. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
      conducted a cohort study that was carried out in a tertiary university hospital
      distinguished by WHO-UNICEF as a BFHI (Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative). A
      group of 53 mother and newborn dyads who had been exposed to intrapartum
      synthetic oxytocin were compared with 45 nonexposed dyads. A breastfeeding
      questionnaire was administered by a midwife blind to patient group through phone 
      calls 3 and 6 months after delivery. RESULTS: No statistically significant
      differences were observed between the two groups in the rates of mothers
      exclusively breastfeeding (EBF) or nonexclusively breastfeeding. The percentage
      of those who were EBF when discharged was 97.3% in the oxytocin-nonexposed group 
      and 87.1% in the oxytocin-exposed group (p = 0.14). At 3 months, the group rates 
      of exclusive breastfeeding were 72.5% in the nonoxytocin-exposed group versus
      65.9% in the oxytocin-exposed group (p = 0.71). At 6 months, rates of
      breastfeeding were 31.4% versus 27.9% (p = 0.53) in the oxytocin-nonexposed and
      oxytocin-exposed groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, no
      statistically significant effect of intrapartum synthetic oxytocin administration
      was observed pertaining to the initiation or duration of breastfeeding.

TI  - Oxytocin Mediates a Calming Effect on Postpartum Mood in Primiparous Mothers.
PG  - 103-109
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2016.0052 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The current study sought to characterize changes in salivary oxytocin
      (OT) secretion patterns across the breastfeeding cycle, and to evaluate whether
      breastfeeding has a positive effect on mood disturbances related to postpartum
      depression, via endogenous OT release. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four
      primiparous mothers who delivered vaginally at term and were exclusively
      breastfeeding were examined 4-5 days postpartum. Salivary OT was measured using
      enzyme immunoassays at 30 minutes before breastfeeding (baseline), during
      breastfeeding (feeding), and 30 minutes after completing breastfeeding
      (postfeeding). In addition, maternal mood changes were evaluated at baseline and 
      postfeeding using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. RESULTS: OT
      levels rose significantly during feeding (pcorr < .05) and postfeeding (pcorr <
      0.05), compared with baseline. POMS scores for Tension-Anxiety were decreased
      postfeeding compared with baseline (p < 0.001). This decrease was significantly
      associated with increased OT (feeding minus baseline: r = -0.52, rpart = -0.51,
      postfeeding minus baseline: r = -0.53, rpart = -0.52, ps < 0.05). POMS scores for
      Fatigue and Confusion also decreased, while Vigor significantly increased.
      Significant correlations were found between Fatigue decreases and OT increases
      (feeding minus baseline: r = -0.48, rpart = -0.53, postfeeding minus baseline:
      rpart = -0.60, ps < 0.05). This result partially contradicted with the finding of
      no correlation between increased Vigor and increased OT. CONCLUSIONS: OT is
      released across the breastfeeding cycle and can be detected with salivary
      measurement. This OT release exhibited a temporary anxiolytic-like calming effect
      on postpartum maternal mood disturbances.

AB  - Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease and stroke,
      leading causes of morbidity and death worldwide. Intrauterine growth restriction 
      (IUGR), caused by an excess of glucocorticoid exposure to the fetus, produces an 
      imbalance in oxidative stress altering many biochemical and epigenetic gene
      transcription processes exposing the fetus and neonate to the 'thrifty' phenotype
      and pervasive polymorphisms appearance damaging health, cognitive, and behavioral
      processes in later life. OT is a major regulator of oxidative stress radicals
      that plays a major role in neonatal maturation of the central nervous system and 
      many peripheral tissues expressing oxytocin/oxytocin-receptor (OT/OTR) system in 
      the early postnatal period. OT and OTR are damaged by IUGR and early stress. This
      review highlights the fact that hypertension is likely to be a legacy of preterm 
      birth due to IUGR and failure to meet nutritional needs in early infancy when fed
      formula instead of breastfeeding or human milk.

TI  - Methods of milk expression for lactating women.
PG  - CD006170
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is important, however not all infants can feed at the
      breast and methods of expressing milk need evaluation. OBJECTIVES: To assess
      acceptability, effectiveness, safety, effect on milk composition, contamination
      and costs of methods of milk expression. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
      Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (21 March 2016), handsearched
      relevant journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts in the field 
      to seek additional published or unpublished studies. We also examined reference
      lists of all relevant retrieved papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and
      quasi-randomised trials comparing methods at any time after birth. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed trials for
      inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. MAIN
      RESULTS: This updated review includes 41 trials involving 2293 participants, with
      22 trials involving 1339 participants contributing data for analysis. Twenty-six 
      of the trials referred to mothers of infants in neonatal units (n = 1547) and 14 
      to mothers of healthy infants at home (n = 730), with one trial containing
      mothers of both neonatal and healthy older infants (n = 16). Eleven trials
      compared one or more types of pump versus hand expression and 14 studies compared
      one type of pump versus another type of pump, with three of these studies
      comparing both hand expression and pump types. Twenty studies compared a specific
      protocol or adjunct behaviour including sequential versus simultaneous pumping
      protocols, pumping frequency, provision of an education and support intervention,
      relaxation, breast massage, combining hand expression with pumping and a breast
      cleansing protocol.Due to heterogeneity in participants, interventions, and
      outcomes measured or reported, we were unable to pool findings for most of the
      specified outcomes. It was not possible therefore to produce a 'Summary of
      findings' table in this update. Most of the included results were derived from
      single studies. Trials took place in 14 countries under a variety of
      circumstances and were published from 1982 to 2015. Sixteen of the 30 trials that
      evaluated pumps or products had support from the manufacturers. The risk of bias 
      of the included studies was variable. Primary outcomesOnly one of the 17 studies 
      examining maternal satisfaction/acceptability with the method or adjunct
      behaviour provided data suitable for analysis. In this study, self-efficacy was
      assessed by asking mothers if they agreed or disagreed with the following
      statement: 'I don't want anyone to see me (hand expressing/pumping)'. The study
      found that mothers who were using the electric pump were more likely to agree
      with the statement compared to mothers hand expressing, (mean difference (MD)
      0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.25; P = 0.01, participants = 68).
      Mothers who were hand expressing reported that the instructions for expression
      were clearer compared to the electric pump, (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.05; P =
      0.02, participants = 68). Descriptive reporting of satisfaction in the other
      studies varied in the measures used, did not indicate a clear preference for one 
      pump type, although there was satisfaction with some relaxation and support
      interventions.We found no clinically significant differences between methods
      related to contamination of the milk that compared any type of pump to hand
      expression (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.61; P = 0.51, participants =
      28), manual pump compared to hand expression, (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.58; P =
      0.30, participants = 142) a large electric pump compared to hand expression (MD
      0.10, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.49; P = 0.61, participants = 123), or a large electric
      pump compared to a manual pump (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.26; P = 0.59,
      participants = 141).The level of maternal breast or nipple pain or damage was
      similar in comparisons of a large electric pump to hand expression (MD 0.02, 95% 
      CI -0.67 to 0.71; P = 0.96, participants = 68). A study comparing a manual and
      large electric pump, reported sore nipples in 7% for both groups and engorgement 
      in 4% using a manual pump versus 6% using an electric pump; and in one study no
      nipple damage was reported in the hand-expression group, and one case of nipple
      damage in each of the manual pump and the large electric pump groups.One study
      examined adverse effects on infants, however as the infants did not all receive
      their mothers' expressed milk, we have not included the results. Secondary
      outcomesThe quantity of expressed milk obtained was increased, in some studies by
      a clinically significant amount, in interventions involving relaxation, music,
      warmth, massage, initiation of pumping, increased frequency of pumping and
      suitable breast shield size. Support programmes and simultaneous compared to
      sequential pumping did not show a difference in milk obtained. No pump
      consistently increased the milk volume obtained significantly.In relation to
      nutrient quality, hand expression or a large electric pump were found to provide 
      higher protein than a manual pump, and hand expression provided higher sodium and
      lower potassium compared to a large electric pump or a manual pump. Fat content
      was higher with breast massage when pumping; no evidence of difference was found 
      for energy content between methods.No consistent effect was found related to
      prolactin change or effect on oxytocin release with pump type or method. Economic
      aspects were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The most suitable method for
      milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the
      individual mother and infant. Low-cost interventions including initiation of milk
      expression sooner after birth when not feeding at the breast, relaxation,
      massage, warming the breasts, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as
      effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes.
      Variation in nutrient content across methods may be relevant to some infants.
      Small sample sizes, large standard deviations, and the diversity of the
      interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method 
      tested in the specific settings. Independently funded research is needed for more
      trials on hand expression, relaxation and other techniques that do not have a
      commercial potential.

TI  - [Effect of oxytocin on human pain perception].
PG  - 457-469
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the years the effect of the neuropeptide oxytocin and its
      possible utilization for pain management has been increasingly more investigated 
      and discussed. Initial results emphasized the effects of oxytocin with respect to
      labor and breastfeeding. Diverse animals studies were also able to demonstrate
      the effectiveness of the peptide in attachment behavior and pain perception;
      however, it is still unclear how oxytocin affects pain perception in humans. The 
      potential therapeutic effectiveness of oxytocin could be particularly important
      for primary and secondary treatment of pain patients because chronification of
      pain can occur more frequently in this area. METHODS: For this review the
      databases PubMed, Medline und PsycINFO were searched using the terms oxytocin,
      pain, human and analgesic. The search resulted in a total of 89 original articles
      after excluding articles regarding labor pain, breastfeeding and animal studies. 
      Only those studies were included which were carried out between 1994 and 2015. A 
      total of 17 articles remained for inclusion in this review and included 13
      studies on the exogenous application of oxytocin and 4 on measurement of oxytocin
      levels in plasma. CONCLUSION: This review article gives a summary of the current 
      state of research on oxytocin and its direct and indirect association with human 
      pain perception and emphasizes its relevance for the multimodal management of
      pain.

TI  - Maternal separation during nursing alters basal neuroendocrine levels in juvenile
      and adult rats.
PG  - 67-77
LID - 10.7705/biomedica.v36i1.2830 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Work with different animal models including that of maternal
      separation during nursing has shown that early adverse experiences such as abuse,
      maternal abandonment and psychosocial stress may favor the development of various
      psychopathologies. However, several neuroendocrine changes have not been
      completely described yet. OBJECTIVE: To establish whether maternal separation
      during nursing modifies the basal levels of neurohormones such as corticosterone,
      ACTH, oxytocin and vasopressin in juvenile and adult rats (aged 35 and 90 days,
      respectively). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were separated from their
      mothers for two periods of 3 hours per day during the 21 days of nursing. Once
      these rats had reached 35 and then 90 days of age, blood samples were taken from 
      both the separated and control groups to obtain serum for immunoenzymatic assays 
      and measure the levels of each of the hormones. RESULTS: Concentrations of
      corticosterone were higher in control adult females in comparison with the rest
      of the groups and lower in the control adult males. Those of ACTH were higher in 
      the separated young males and females than in the adult groups. Oxytocin levels
      were significantly higher in the separated adult females in comparison with the
      other groups and significantly lower in the adult males. With respect to
      vasopressin, the separated groups had lower concentrations than the young and
      adult control groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the early stress to
      which rats were submitted produced changes in the basal responses of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, that these responses were distinct in males 
      and females and that they also differed according to age.

TI  - Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) as a Marker of Clinical Disorders.
PG  - 211-8
AB  - Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is an important protein, not only for
      transporting sex steroids which is its primary role, but with the discovery of a 
      specific receptor that binds SHBG, a novel approach regarding classic
      'free-hormone hypothesis' should be implemented. Research in SHBG gene and it
      expression has been done, as well as cellular signaling that controls it. It
      provides significant knowledge of the impact of certain well -defined cellular
      level signaling pathways and how they affect the level of SHBG production.
      Moreover, new insights have proven that SHBG isn't just a peripherally
      synthesized protein. Its origin has been proven to exist in the brain, namely in 
      the hypothalamus and the pituitary, where it is spatially closely related to
      oxytocin-producing neurons. The main peripheral organ that produces SHBG is the
      liver. Since the liver is the central metabolic organ, certain metabolic diseases
      will result in changed SHBG serum levels. On the other hand, endocrine disorders 
      that affect tissues involved in sex hormone regulation will also have an impact
      on SHBG levels. Thusly, SHBG stands as one of the mediators between various
      endocrine tissues and definitely contributes with its own pathophysiological role
      in diseases such as: obesity, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome,
      osteoporosis, breast and prostate cancer. Its value expands to the area of
      clinical medicine as a marker of certain pathological states. Some studies
      already established its reliability and the growing trend to implement it as a
      useful clinical marker is present. It still remains largely understudied, from
      physiological and clinical aspect, but recent findings give notions that SHBG
      plays an important role in health and disease and could be a useful assessment
      marker.

TI  - Endocrine disruption by dietary phyto-oestrogens: impact on dimorphic sexual
      systems and behaviours.
PG  - 130-144
LID - 10.1017/S0029665116000677 [doi]
AB  - A wide range of health benefits have been ascribed to soya intake including a
      lowered risk of osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer, and menopausal
      symptoms. Because it is a hormonally active diet, however, soya can also be
      endocrine disrupting, suggesting that intake has the potential to cause adverse
      health effects in certain circumstances, particularly when exposure occurs during
      development. Consequently, the question of whether or not soya phyto-oestrogens
      are beneficial or harmful to human health is neither straightforward nor
      universally applicable to all groups. Possible benefits and risks depend on age, 
      health status, and even the presence or absence of specific gut microflora. As
      global consumption increases, greater awareness and consideration of the
      endocrine-disrupting properties of soya by nutrition specialists and other health
      practitioners is needed. Consumption by infants and small children is of
      particular concern because their hormone-sensitive organs, including the brain
      and reproductive system, are still undergoing sexual differentiation and
      maturation. Thus, their susceptibility to the endocrine-disrupting activities of 
      soya phyto-oestrogens may be especially high. As oestrogen receptor partial
      agonists with molecular and cellular properties similar to anthropogenic
      endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A, the soya phyto-oestrogens provide an
      interesting model for how attitudes about what is 'synthetic' v. what is
      'natural,' shapes understanding and perception of what it means for a compound to
      be endocrine disrupting and/or potentially harmful. This review describes the
      endocrine-disrupting properties of soya phyto-oestrogens with a focus on
      neuroendocrine development and behaviour.

TI  - Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation.
PG  - CD006946
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006946.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast engorgement is a painful condition affecting large numbers of 
      women in the early postpartum period. It may lead to premature weaning, cracked
      nipples, mastitis and breast abscess. Various forms of treatment for engorgement 
      have been studied but so far little evidence has been found on an effective
      intervention. OBJECTIVES: This is an update of a systematic review first
      published by Snowden et al. in 2001 and subsequently published in 2010. The
      objective of this update is to seek new information on the best forms of
      treatment for breast engorgement in lactating women. SEARCH METHODS: We
      identified studies for inclusion through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth
      Group's Trials Register (30 June 2015) and searched reference lists of retrieved 
      studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials.
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials
      for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. Where
      insufficient data were presented in trial reports, we attempted to contact study 
      authors and obtain necessary information. We assessed the quality of the evidence
      using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: In total, we included 13 studies with 919
      women. In 10 studies individual women were the unit of analysis and in three
      studies, individual breasts were the unit of analysis. Four out of 13 studies
      were funded by an agency with a commercial interest, two received charitable
      funding, and two were funded by government agencies.Trials examined interventions
      including non-medical treatments: cabbage leaves (three studies), acupuncture
      (two studies), ultrasound (one study), acupressure (one study), scraping therapy 
      (Gua Sha) (one study), cold breast-packs and electromechanical massage (one
      study), and medical treatments: serrapeptase (one study), protease (one study)
      and subcutaneous oxytocin (one study). The studies were small and used different 
      comparisons with only single studies contributing data to outcomes of this
      review. We were unable to pool results in meta-analysis and only seven studies
      provided outcome data that could be included in data and analysis. Non-medical No
      differences were observed in the one study comparing acupuncture with usual care 
      (advice and oxytocin spray) (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI)
      0.13 to 1.92; one study; 140 women) in terms of cessation of breastfeeding.
      However, women in the acupuncture group were less likely to develop an abscess
      (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.01; one study; 210 women), had less severe symptoms on
      day five (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99), and had a lower rate of pyrexia (RR
      0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94) than women in the usual care group.In another study
      with 39 women comparing cabbage leaf extract with placebo, no differences were
      observed in breast pain (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI -0.67 to 1.47;
      low-quality evidence) or breast engorgement (MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.58;
      low-quality evidence). There was no difference between ultrasound and sham
      treatment in analgesic requirement (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.51; one study; 45
      women; low-quality evidence). A study comparing Gua-Sha therapy with hot packs
      and massage found a marked difference in breast engorgement (MD -2.42, 95% CI
      -2.98 to -1.86; one study; 54 women), breast pain (MD -2.01, 95% CI -2.60 to
      -1.42; one study; 54 women) and breast discomfort (MD -2.33, 95% CI -2.81 to
      -1.85; one study; 54 women) in favour of Gua-Sha therapy five minutes
      post-intervention, though both interventions significantly decreased breast
      temperature, engorgement, pain and discomfort at five and 30 minutes
      post-treatment.Results from individual trials that could not be included in data 
      analysis suggested that there were no differences between room temperature and
      chilled cabbage leaves and between chilled cabbage leaves and gel packs, with all
      interventions producing some relief. Intermittent hot/cold packs applied for 20
      minutes twice a day were found to be more effective than acupressure (P < 0.001).
      Acupuncture did not improve maternal satisfaction with breastfeeding. In another 
      study, women who received breast-shaped cold packs were more likely to experience
      a reduction in pain intensity than women who received usual care; however, the
      differences between groups at baseline, and the failure to observe randomisation,
      make this study at high risk of bias. One study found a decrease in breast
      temperature (P = 0.03) following electromechanical massage and pumping in
      comparison to manual methods; however, the high level of attrition and
      alternating method of sequence generation place this study at high risk of bias. 
      MedicalWomen treated with protease complex were less likely to have no
      improvement in pain (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.74; one study; 59 women) and
      swelling (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; one study; 59 women) on the fourth day of
      treatment and less likely to experience no overall change in their symptoms or
      worsening of symptoms (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.56). It should be noted that it 
      is more than 40 years since the study was carried out, and we are not aware that 
      this preparation is used in current practice. Subcutaneous oxytocin provided no
      relief at all in symptoms at three days (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.68 to 14.44; one
      study; 45 women).Serrapeptase was found to produce some relief in breast pain,
      induration and swelling, when compared to placebo, with a fewer number of women
      experiencing slight to no improvement in overallbreast engorgement, swelling and 
      breast pain.Overall, the risk of bias of studies in the review is high. The
      overall quality as assessed using the GRADE approach was found to be low due to
      limitations in study design and the small number of women in the included
      studies, with only single studies providing data for analysis. AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Although some interventions such as hot/cold packs, Gua-Sha
      (scraping therapy), acupuncture, cabbage leaves and proteolytic enzymes may be
      promising for the treatment of breast engorgement during lactation, there is
      insufficient evidence from published trials on any intervention to justify
      widespread implementation. More robust research is urgently needed on the
      treatment of breast engorgement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal stress in humans influences behavior of children and can be
      assessed using biological markers. Mothers and their one-month-old infants were
      recruited from an existing study to examine baseline maternal serum oxytocin and 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to infant blood heel stick stress as
      measured by salivary cortisol in the dyads. Objectives were to explore (1)
      relationships between mother and infant cortisol levels, (2) gender differences
      in infant biologic cortisol response, and (3) the association of cortisol levels 
      in the dyads and maternal oxytocin levels METHODS: Forty-two mother-infant dyads 
      provided biologic samples and self-report data. Maternal oxytocin samples were
      obtained. Initial salivary cortisol was assessed in both the mother and infant,
      followed by a heel stick blood draw. Twenty minutes later, salivary cortisol was 
      collected again from dyads. RESULTS: Self-report measures were negative for
      depression and risk for childhood neglect. Although oxytocin and baseline
      cortisol in the infants was higher in mothers that did some breast-feeding, there
      was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.2 and p = 0.1, respectively). 
      Analyses showed (a) higher baseline cortisol in mothers was related to higher
      baseline cortisol in infants (p </= 0.0001), (b) following the stressor, female
      infants had a larger positive change in cortisol, after adjusting for baseline
      cortisol (p = 0.045), and (c) there was no relationship between dyad cortisol
      levels and maternal oxytocin. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal and infant biologic stress
      measures are related. Female infants have a larger hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      response to a blood draw stressor as measured by salivary cortisol than male
      infants.

AB  - Social environment is a well-recognized determinant in health and wellbeing.
      Among breast cancer patients, inadequate social support is associated with a
      substantial increase in cancer-related mortality. A common explanation is that
      socially isolated individuals fare worse due to reduced instrumental support
      (i.e., assistance meeting the demands of treatment). However, the ability to
      replicate the detrimental effects of social isolation on mammary tumor growth in 
      rodents strongly suggests an alternative explanation; i.e., socially isolated
      individuals have a physiological milieu that promotes tumor growth. This review
      summarizes the clinical and basic science literature supporting social influences
      on breast cancer, and provides a conceptual physiological framework for these
      effects. We propose that social environment contributes to the vast individual
      differences in prognosis among breast cancer survivors because social environment
      is capable of altering basic physiological processes, which in turn can modulate 
      tumor growth. Appreciation of the role of social environment in breast cancer
      progression could promote the identification of patients at increased risk for
      poor outcomes. In addition, characterization of the underlying physiological
      mechanisms could lead to targeted disruption of detrimental pathways that promote
      tumor progression in socially isolated individuals, or exploitation of protective
      pathways activated through social engagement as novel therapeutic complements to 
      contemporary treatments.

TI  - Labor Epidural Analgesia and Breastfeeding: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 507-20
LID - 10.1177/0890334415623779 [doi]
AB  - Despite widespread use of epidural analgesia during labor, no consensus has been 
      reached among obstetric and anesthesia providers regarding its effects on
      breastfeeding. The purpose of this review was to examine the relationship between
      labor epidural analgesia and breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum period.
      PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
      Literature were searched for articles published in 1990 or thereafter, using the 
      search term breastfeeding combined with epidural, labor epidural analgesia, labor
      analgesia, or epidural analgesia Of 117 articles, 23 described empirical studies 
      specific to labor epidural analgesia and measured a breastfeeding outcome.
      Results were conflicting: 12 studies showed negative associations between
      epidural analgesia and breastfeeding success, 10 studies showed no effect, and 1 
      study showed a positive association. Most studies were observational. Of 3
      randomized controlled studies, randomization methods were inadequate in 2 and not
      evaluable in 1. Other limitations were related to small sample size or inadequate
      study power; variation and lack of information regarding type and dosage of
      analgesia or use of other intrapartum interventions; differences in timing,
      definition, and method of assessing breastfeeding success; or failure to consider
      factors such as mothers' intention to breastfeed, social support, siblings, or
      the mother's need to return to work or school. It is also unclear to what extent 
      results are mediated through effects on infant neurobehavior, maternal fever,
      oxytocin release, duration of labor, and need for instrumental delivery.
      Clinician awareness of factors affecting breastfeeding can help identify women at
      risk for breastfeeding difficulties in order to target support and resources
      effectively.

TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid oxytocin correlated with peripheral ALT and AST in Chinese
      female subjects.
PG  - 689-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oxytocin (OT) is primarily synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus 
      of the hypothalamus and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus in the central
      nervous system and exhibits a wide spectrum of central and peripheral activities.
      OT is involved in lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis and plays a protective
      role against liver damage. METHODS: In this study, we investigated whether CSF OT
      levels correlates with peripheral glucose, lipid profiles, and/or liver enzymes
      in Chinese subjects. Sixty-nine subjects (n=36 males; n=33 females) who were
      recruited from Beijing Jishuitan Hospital participated in the study. Their levels
      of CSF OT and peripheral parameters were assayed by radioimmunoassay and
      continuous monitoring assay, respectively. RESULTS: There was no significant
      difference in CSF OT levels between males (53.09+/-6.88 nmol/mL) and females
      (52.34+/-6.87 nmol/mL), and no correlation found between CSF OT levels and
      peripheral glucose and lipid profiles. Significant negative correlation was
      observed between CSF OT levels and peripheral ALT and AST concentration in
      females but not in males. CONCLUSION: Our results support the physiological role 
      of neuropeptides acting on brain sites to regulate liver enzymes, and shed new
      light on the brain-liver interaction.

TI  - Breastfeeding or nipple stimulation for reducing postpartum haemorrhage in the
      third stage of labour.
PG  - CD010845
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010845.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxytocin and prostaglandin are hormones responsible for uterine
      contraction during the third stage of labour. Receptors in the uterine muscles
      are stimulated by exogenous or endogenous oxytocin leading to uterine
      contractions. Nipple stimulation or breastfeeding are stimuli that can lead to
      the secretion of oxytocin and consequent uterine contractions. Consequently,
      uterine contractions can reduce bleeding during the third stage of labour.
      OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of breastfeeding or nipple stimulation on 
      postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) during the third stage of labour. SEARCH METHODS: We
      searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (15 July
      2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised
      and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing breast stimulation,
      breastfeeding or suckling for PPH in the third stage of labour were selected for 
      this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently
      assessed studies for inclusion in terms of risk of bias and independently
      extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by a third review author. MAIN
      RESULTS: We included four trials (4608 women), but only two studies contributed
      data to the review's analyses (n = 4472). The studies contributing data were
      assessed as of high risk of bias overall. One of these studies was
      cluster-randomised and conducted in a low-income country and the other study was 
      carried out in a high-income country. All four included studies assessed blood
      loss in the third stage of labour. Birth attendants estimated blood loss in two
      trials. The third trial assessed the hematocrit level on the second day
      postpartum to determine the effect of the bleeding. The fourth study measured PPH
      >/= 500 mL. Nipple stimulation versus no treatmentOne study (4385 women) compared
      the effect of suckling versus no treatment. Blood loss was not measured in 114
      women (59 in control group and 55 in suckling group). After excluding twin
      pregnancies, stillbirths and neonatal deaths, the main analyses for this trial
      were performed on 4227 vaginal deliveries. In terms of maternal death or severe
      morbidity, one maternal death occurred in the suckling group due to retained
      placenta (risk ratio (RR) 3.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 74.26; one
      study, participants = 4227; very low quality evidence); severe morbidity was not 
      mentioned. Severe PPH (>/= 1000 mL) was not reported in this study.The incidence 
      of PPH (>/= 500 mL) was similar in the suckling and no treatment groups (RR 0.95,
      95% CI 0.77 to 1.16; one study, participants = 4227; moderate quality). There
      were no group differences between nipple stimulation and no treatment regarding
      blood loss in the third stage of labour (mean difference (MD) 2.00, 95% CI -7.39 
      to 11.39; one study, participants = 4227; low quality). The rates of retained
      placenta were similar (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.16; one study, participants =
      4227; very low quality evidence), as were perinatal deaths (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.57 
      to 1.98; one study, participants = 4271; low quality), and maternal readmission
      to hospital (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.16; one study, participants = 4227; very
      low quality). We downgraded the evidence for this comparison for risk of bias
      concerns in the one included trial (inappropriate analyses for cluster design)
      and for imprecision (wide CIs crossing the line of no difference and, for some
      outcomes, few events).Many maternal secondary outcomes (including side effects)
      were not reported. Similarly, most neonatal secondary outcomes were not reported.
      Nipple stimulation versus oxytocinAnother study compared the effect of nipple
      stimulation (via a breast pump) with oxytocin. Eighty-seven women were recruited 
      but only 85 women were analysed. Severe PPH >/= 1000 mL and maternal death or
      severe morbidity were not reported.There was no clear effect of nipple
      stimulation on blood loss (MD 15.00, 95% CI -24.50 to 54.50; one study,
      participants = 85; low quality evidence), or on postnatal anaemia compared to the
      oxytocin group (MD -0.40, 95% CI -2.22 to 1.42; one study, participants = 85; low
      quality evidence). We downgraded evidence for this comparison due to risk of bias
      concerns in the one included trial (alternate allocation) and for imprecision
      (wide CIs crossing the line of no difference and small sample size).Many maternal
      secondary outcomes (including side effects) were not reported, and none of this
      review's neonatal secondary outcomes were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: None of
      the included studies reported one of this review's primary outcomes: severe PPH
      >/= 1000 mL. Only one study reported on maternal death or severe morbidity. There
      were limited secondary outcome data for maternal outcomes and very few secondary 
      outcome data for neonatal outcomes.There was no clear differences between nipple 
      stimulation (suckling) versus no treatment in relation to maternal death, the
      incidence of PPH (>/= 500 mL), blood loss in the third stage of labour, retained 
      placenta, perinatal deaths or maternal readmission to hospital. Whilst these data
      are based on a single study with a reasonable sample size, the quality of these
      data are mostly low or very low.There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the
      effect of nipple stimulation for reducing postpartum haemorrhage during the third
      stage of labour and more evidence from high-quality studies is needed. Further
      high-quality studies should recruit adequate sample sizes, assess the impact of
      nipple stimulation compared to uterotonic agents such as syntometrine and
      oxytocin, and report on important outcomes such as those listed in this review.

TI  - Method for collecting mouse milk without exogenous oxytocin stimulation.
PG  - 47-9
LID - 10.2144/000114373 [doi]
AB  - It has been reported that breast-feeding more than 6 months strongly decreases
      the risk of allergy, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension in humans. In order to
      understand the mechanisms responsible for this benefit, it is important to
      evaluate precisely the composition of maternal milk, especially in response to
      environmental cues. Mouse models offer a unique opportunity to study the impact
      of maternal milk composition on the development and health of offspring. Oxytocin
      injection of the dam is usually used to stimulate milk ejection; however,
      exogenous oxytocin might have deleterious effects under some experimental
      conditions by modifying milk content as well as the physiology and behavior of
      the dam. Taking advantage of the natural stimulation of the mammary gland that
      occurs after the reunion of a dam that has been separated from her pups, we
      developed a new procedure to collect mouse milk without the injection of
      oxytocin. This method is easy to use, low-cost ,and non-invasive. Moreover, it
      provides a sufficient amount of milk for use in a wide range of biological
      analyses.

TI  - Pronurturance Plus at birth: A risk reduction strategy for preventing postpartum 
      haemorrhage.

LID - 10.1016/j.wombi.2015.11.007 [doi]
LID - S1871-5192(15)00355-8 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) rates continue to rise in the developed 
      world. A recent study found that any skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding
      within 30min of birth was associated with an almost 50% reduction in PPH rates.
      Improved oxytocin release is the biological reason proposed to explain this. The 
      combination of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding within 30min of birth is
      termed 'Pronurturance'. Midwifery theory and research claims that optimal third
      stage care is more holistic than simple Pronurturnace which suggests that further
      reductions in PPH rates may be possible. QUESTION: What can midwives and women do
      to minimise blood loss in the third and fourth stages of labour? METHOD: We
      present a new theory that describes and explains how to optimise the woman's
      reproductive psychophysiology in the third and fourth stages of labour to ensure 
      a well contracted uterus which inhibits excessive bleeding regardless of risk
      status or whether active management was used. In developing the Pronurturance
      Plus theory we expand upon what is already known about oxytocin in relation to
      simple pronurturance to integrate concepts from birth territory theory, cognitive
      neuroscience, mindfulness psychology and the autonomic nervous system to develop 
      an holistic understanding of how to optimise care and minimise PPH. CONCLUSION:
      Pronurturance Plus is a psycho-biologically grounded theory which is consistent
      with existing evidence. It is free, natural and socially desirable.

TI  - Intrapartum Synthetic Oxytocin and Its Effects on Maternal Well-Being at 2 Months
      Postpartum.
PG  - 28-35
LID - 10.1111/birt.12198 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Synthetic oxytocin (synOT) is commonly used in labor management to
      induce and augment labor, and to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. However, its
      long-term consequences for maternal health and behavior are largely understudied.
      We examined the relationship between synOT and maternal oxytocin levels,
      breastfeeding, and maternal mental health at 2 months postpartum. METHODS: Women 
      were recruited during pregnancy or within 48 hours of giving birth through
      obstetric practices and hospitals. A total of 386 women were visited in their
      homes at 2 months postpartum, where they completed questionnaires assessing
      breastfeeding, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and somatization.
      Oxytocin levels were obtained from blood samples and synOT dosage information was
      gathered from hospital charts. RESULTS: Intrapartum synOT dose was positively
      correlated with endogenous oxytocin levels at 2 months postpartum. Women who were
      exclusively breastfeeding at 2 months postpartum had received significantly less 
      synOT compared with their nonexclusively breastfeeding counterparts. Higher synOT
      dose was associated with greater depressive, anxious, and somatization symptoms. 
      SynOT dose was not associated with perinatal posttraumatic stress. CONCLUSIONS:
      The widespread use of synOT in managed labor warrants caution, as the influence
      of synOT on a new mother's well-being is evident at 2 months postpartum.

TI  - The Association Between Common Labor Drugs and Suckling When Skin-to-Skin During 
      the First Hour After Birth.
PG  - 319-28
LID - 10.1111/birt.12186 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrapartum drugs, including fentanyl administered via epidural and
      synthetic oxytocin, have been previously studied in relation to neonatal
      outcomes, especially breastfeeding, with conflicting results. We examined the
      normal neonatal behavior of suckling within the first hour after a vaginal birth 
      while in skin-to-skin contact with mother in relation to these commonly used
      drugs. Suckling in the first hour after birth has been shown in other studies to 
      increase desirable breastfeeding outcomes. METHOD: Prospective comparative
      design. Sixty-three low-risk mothers self-selected to labor with intrapartum
      analgesia/anesthesia or not. Video recordings of infants during the first hour
      after birth while being held skin-to-skin with their mother were coded and
      analyzed to ascertain whether or not they achieved Stage 8 (suckling) of
      Widstrom's 9 Stages of newborn behavior during the first hour after birth.
      RESULTS: A strong inverse correlation was found between the amount and duration
      of exposure to epidural fentanyl and the amount of synthetic oxytocin against the
      likelihood of achieving suckling during the first hour after a vaginal birth.
      CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that intrapartum exposure to the drugs fentanyl and 
      synthetic oxytocin significantly decreased the likelihood of the baby suckling
      while skin-to-skin with its mother during the first hour after birth.

TI  - The Effect of Uterine and Nipple Stimulation on Induction With Oxytocin and the
      Labor Process.

LID - 10.1111/wvn.12116 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The present research study was conducted with the objective of determining 
      the effect of uterine and nipple stimulation on induction with oxytocin and the
      birth process. METHODS: A randomized controlled experiment was conducted at the
      maternity ward of a state hospital located in the province of Sivas in Turkey.
      Three hundred ninety pregnant women who were giving birth via vaginal delivery
      were randomly assigned to three groups (nipple stimulation, uterine stimulation, 
      control). After the birth, the groups were assessed in terms of the birth
      duration and synthetic induction with oxytocin. Statistical analyses were
      performed through the use of SPSS 14.0 software and included analysis of
      variance, Tukey's test, Dunnett's test, Tamhane's T2 test, and chi-square test.
      RESULTS: The study established statistically significant differences (p < .05)
      among the groups in terms of the average durations of the first, second and third
      phases of the action of birth, the status concerning delivery by C-section and
      the application of labor induction. The phases of birth were shorter for the
      nipple stimulation group (first phase: 3.8 hours, second phase: 16 minutes, third
      phase: 5 minutes) and the uterine stimulation group (first phase: 4.0 hours,
      second phase: 21 minutes, third phase: 6 minutes) when compared to the control
      group (first phase: 6.8 hours, second phase: 27 minutes, third phase: 6 minutes).
      In the control group, 89.2% of the pregnant women were subject to labor induction
      and 8.5% to cesarean section. No women in the nipple stimulation group or uterine
      stimulation group had a cesarean section. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Nipple and 
      uterine stimulation reduce the frequency of elective labor induction, the rate of
      relevant complications, and support normal vaginal birth by providing endogenous 
      labor induction. Therefore, these interventions should be considered for pregnant
      women in labor.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Immediate skin-to-skin contact (ISSC) and early breastfeeding are
      recommended for the wellbeing of the neonate. In this study, we aimed to evaluate
      the effect of ISSC and early breastfeeding on maternal oxidative stress and
      postoperative pain. METHODS: A total of 90 patients were randomized into two
      groups based on the timing of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding. Group 1 (n 
      = 45) was provided ISSC and breastfeeding in the operating room during the
      cesarean section (C/S). Group 2 (n = 45) breastfed their babies 1 h after the
      C/S. As markers of oxidative stress, maternal serum levels of total antioxidant
      status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress indices (OSI) were 
      evaluated. Maternal oxytocin levels and the relation between these parameters and
      postoperative pain were also evaluated. RESULTS: The postoperative TAS levels
      were significantly higher, whereas TOS and OSI levels were lower in Group 1 than 
      Group 2. Negative correlations between oxytocin level and postoperative TOS and
      OSI were observed, as was a positive correlation between oxytocin level and
      postoperative TAS. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of ISSC and early breastfeeding on
      mothers was documented for the first time in this study. Our results demonstrated
      ISSC and early breastfeeding during C/S reduce maternal oxidative stress.

AB  - Women's health is seriously impacted by sexual dysfunction, mental depression,
      breast cancer, and gynecological cancers. Breast feeding has been found to reduce
      the risk of in-situ cervical cancer, endometrial cancer of the uterus, ovarian
      cancer, and breast cancer. This protective effect of breast feeding supports the 
      notion that another functional use of the breast, sexual breast stimulation,
      promoted by women to incite their sexual arousal and orgasm, is a practice which 
      also reduces the risk of these same cancers, and protects against sexual
      dysfunction and mental depression. The significance of the practice of breast sex
      or "sexual breast love" lies with its deeply rooted past in the founding of our
      species, Homo sapiens. No other species exhibits breast sex, a human cultural
      activity that is implicated in women's desire, sexual satisfaction, and the
      development of human sociality. For species females as a whole, nipple
      stimulation by a partner during sex, over the adult life of a female, has
      occurred since the inception of H. sapiens, so that the failure to engage in this
      activity is counter to a species typical practice and endangers women's health.
      Breast sex results in nipple erection, and may micmic the effects of breast
      feeding, causing an increase of oxytocin in the body. Breast sex is an enriched
      type of sexuality that enables love between the sexes and the pair bond. The
      intimacy of breast sex creates a common ground of sexual knowledge, allowing
      empathy, cooperation, commitment, and communication. It induces reciprocity and
      therefore happiness. With breast sex, there is an increase of the positive
      emotions over the chimpanzees, promoting advanced cognition. Research into
      whether oxytocin release is caused by stimulation of the breasts in non-lactating
      women is inconclusive, but cultural studies demonstrate that breast stimulation
      induces sexual arousal, and research has shown that sexual arousal is associated 
      with oxytocin release.

AB  - Intranasal oxytocin (OXT) application is emerging as a potential treatment for
      socio-emotional disorders associated with abnormalities in OXT system (re-)
      activity. The crucial identification of patients with such abnormalities could be
      streamlined by the assessment of basal and stimulus-induced OXT concentrations in
      saliva, using a simple, stress-free sampling procedure (i.e. an OXT challenge
      test). We therefore established the Regensburg Oxytocin Challenge (ROC) test to
      further validate salivary OXT concentrations as a practical, reliable and
      sensitive biomarker. OXT concentrations were quantified by radioimmunoassay in
      samples collected at home by healthy adult male and female volunteers before and 
      after running ("Run") or sexual self-stimulation ("Sex"). In lactating women,
      salivary OXT concentrations were quantified before, during and after
      breastfeeding. Salivary OXT along with salivary cortisol and heart rate were
      monitored in healthy adult participants undergoing the Trier Social Stress Test
      (TSST). The home-based "Run" and "Sex" challenges as well as the laboratory-based
      TSST caused quantifiable, rapid, and consistent increases in salivary OXT
      (approximately 2.5-fold after 10-15min), which were similar for men and women.
      Breastfeeding did not result in measurably increased salivary OXT levels,
      probably because the short pulses of OXT release characteristic for lactation
      were missed. Taken together, ROC tests reliably assess the responsiveness of the 
      OXT system (i.e., the increase in salivary OXT concentrations as compared to
      basal levels) to challenges such as "Run" and "Sex" at home or psychosocial
      stress (TSST) in the laboratory. Further studies with larger sample numbers are
      essentially needed in order to reveal individual differences in ROC test outcomes
      depending on, for example, genetic or environmental factors.

TI  - Genetic variation in CD38 and breastfeeding experience interact to impact
      infants' attention to social eye cues.
PG  - E5434-42
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1506352112 [doi]
AB  - Attending to emotional information conveyed by the eyes is an important social
      skill in humans. The current study examined this skill in early development by
      measuring attention to eyes while viewing emotional faces in 7-mo-old infants. In
      particular, we investigated individual differences in infant attention to eyes in
      the context of genetic variation (CD38 rs3796863 polymorphism) and experiential
      variation (exclusive breastfeeding duration) related to the oxytocin system. Our 
      results revealed that, whereas infants at this age show a robust fear bias
      (increased attention to fearful eyes), their attention to angry and happy eyes
      varies as a function of exclusive breastfeeding experience and genetic variation 
      in CD38. Specifically, extended exclusive breastfeeding duration selectively
      enhanced looking preference to happy eyes and decreased looking to angry eyes.
      Importantly, however, this interaction was impacted by CD38 variation, such that 
      only the looking preferences of infants homozygous for the C allele of rs3796863 
      were affected by breastfeeding experience. This genotype has been associated with
      reduced release of oxytocin and higher rates of autism. In contrast, infants with
      the CA/AA genotype showed similar looking preferences regardless of breastfeeding
      exposure. Thus, differences in the sensitivity to emotional eyes may be linked to
      an interaction between the endogenous (CD38) and exogenous (breastfeeding)
      availability of oxytocin. These findings underline the importance of maternal
      care and the oxytocin system in contributing to the early development of
      responding to social eye cues.

      Wales (NSW) Australia. PARTICIPANTS: after excluding women (n=3671) who did not
      have opportunity for skin to skin and breast feeding, I analysed birth records
      (n=7548) for the calendar years 2009 and 2010. Records were accessed via the
      electronic data base ObstetriX. INTERVENTION: skin to skin contact and breast
      feeding within 30 minutes of birth. MEASURES: outcome measure was PPH i.e. blood 
      loss of 500ml or more estimated at birth. Data was analysed using descriptive
      statistics and logistic regression (unadjusted and adjusted). FINDINGS: after
      adjustment for covariates, women who did not have skin to skin and breast feeding
      were almost twice as likely to have a PPH compared to women who had both skin to 
      skin contact and breast feeding (aOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.72, p<0.001). This
      apparently protective effect of skin to skin and breast feeding on PPH held true 
      in sub-analyses for both women at 'lower' (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.17-0.30, p<0.001)
      and 'higher' risk (OR 0.37 95% CI 0.24-0.57), p<0.001. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND
      IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: this study suggests that skin to skin contact and
      breastfeeding immediately after birth may be effective in reducing PPH rates for 
      women at any level of risk of PPH. The greatest effect was for women at lower
      risk of PPH. The explanation is that pronurturance promotes endogenous oxytocin
      release. Childbearing women should be educated and supported to have
      pronurturance during third and fourth stages of labour.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Decline and resurgence of breastfeeding (BF) characterized last
      century. Several factors influencing BF outcome were identified. Despite the huge
      literature on BF, no data on its matrilineal transmission are available. BF
      practice was prospectively followed in 2546 Italian mothers. Lactation and BF
      outcome were related, besides to known factors interfering with BF, to the
      occurrence of previous maternal and paternal BF. Recalls of grandmaternal and
      grand-grandmaternal BF behaviours allowed the construction of familiar pedigrees 
      of BF across three generations. Having been breastfed was the strongest factor
      addressing successful BF establishment (odds ratio (OR) 9.33; 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 7.40-11.84; p < 0.0001) and BF duration (at 6 months: OR 3.79; 95% 
      CI 3.11-4.64; p < 0.0001). The hazard ratio for breastfed vs non-breastfed
      mothers was 0.46 (95% CI 0.41-0.50; log-rank p < 0.0001). The rate of BF failures
      was fivefold higher in non-breastfed mothers, mostly occurring during
      lactogenesis when the let-down reflex becomes essential. CONCLUSION: At any
      generation, mothers are likely to have daughters repeating their BF experience.
      Differently from the intergenerational effects of environmental factors
      responsible for the BF secular trend, this trait is transgenerationally
      transmitted and reversible, with temporal and clinical features of lactation
      failure. Accordingly, we speculate that epigenetic mechanisms might alter
      offspring's oxytocinergic receptor signalling. WHAT IS KNOWN: Several cultural
      and socio-demographic factors are known to influence breastfeeding outcome. The
      generational effects of breastfeeding itself have not been investigated so far.
      WHAT IS NEW: Maternal breastfeeding is the most important factor addressing
      daughters' breastfeeding outcome. This behavior is transmitted
      transgenerationally, with features suggesting epigenetic mechanisms.

AB  - This article is part of a Special Issue "Parental Care".Producing milk to support
      the growth of their young is a central element of maternal care in mammals. In
      spite of the facts that ecological constraints influence nursing frequency,
      length of time until weaning and the composition of milk, there is considerable
      similarity in the anatomy and physiology of milk production and delivery across
      mammalian species. Here we provide an overview of cross species variation in
      nursing patterns and milk composition as well as the mechanisms underlying
      mammary gland development, milk production and letdown. Not all women breastfeed 
      their infants, thus in later sections we review studies of factors that
      facilitate or impede the initiation and duration of breastfeeding. The results of
      these investigations suggest that the decisions to initiate and maintain
      breastfeeding are influenced by an array of personal, social and biological
      factors. Finally, studies comparing the development of breastfed and formula fed 
      infants as well as those investigating associations between breastfeeding,
      maternal health and mother/infant interaction are reviewed. Leading health
      agencies including the World Health Organization and CDC advocate breastfeeding
      for at least the first 6months postpartum. To achieve these rates will require
      not only institutional support but also a focus on individual mother/infant dyads
      and their experience.

TI  - Repeated nipple fluid aspiration: compliance and feasibility results from a
      prospective multicenter study.
PG  - e0127895
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0127895 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite intensive surveillance, a high rate of interval malignancies 
      is still seen in women at increased breast cancer risk. Therefore, novel
      screening modalities aiming at early detection remain needed. The intraductal
      approach offers the possibility to directly sample fluid containing cells, DNA
      and proteins from the mammary ductal system where, in the majority of cases,
      breast cancer originates. Fluid from the breast can non-invasively be obtained by
      oxytocin-assisted vacuum aspiration, called nipple fluid aspiration (NFA). The
      goal of this feasibility study was to evaluate the potential of repeated NFA,
      which is a critical and essential step to evaluate its possible value as a breast
      cancer screening method. METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective study, we
      annually collected nipple fluid for up to 5 consecutive years from women at
      increased breast cancer risk, and performed a questionnaire-based survey
      regarding discomfort of the aspiration. Endpoints of the current interim analyses
      were the feasibility and results of 994 NFA procedures in 451 women with total
      follow-up of 560 person years of observation. RESULTS: In this large group of
      women at increased risk of breast cancer, repetitive NFA appeared to be feasible 
      and safe. In 66.4% of aspirated breasts, nipple fluid was successfully obtained. 
      Independent predictive factors for successful NFA were premenopausal status,
      spontaneous nipple discharge, smaller breast size, bilateral oophorectomy and
      previous use of hormone replacement therapy or anti-hormonal treatment. The
      procedure was well tolerated with low discomfort. Drop-out rate was 20%, which
      was mainly due to repeated unsuccessful aspiration attempts. Only 1.6% of women
      prematurely declined further participation because of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Repeated NFA in women at increased breast cancer risk is feasible and safe.
      Therefore, NFA is a promising method to non-invasively obtain a valuable source
      of potential breast cancer specific biomarkers.

TI  - Intrapartum synthetic oxytocin reduce the expression of primitive reflexes
      associated with breastfeeding.
PG  - 209-13
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2014.0156 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Several synthetic peptide manipulations during the time surrounding birth
      can alter the specific neurohormonal status in the newborn brain. This study is
      aimed at assessing whether intrapartum oxytocin administration has any effect on 
      primitive neonatal reflexes and determining whether such an effect is
      dose-dependent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort prospective study was conducted
      at a tertiary hospital. Mother-infant dyads who received intrapartum oxytocin
      (n=53) were compared with mother-infant dyads who did not receive intrapartum
      oxytocin (n=45). Primitive neonatal reflexes (endogenous, antigravity, motor, and
      rhythmic reflexes) were quantified by analyzing videotaped breastfeeding sessions
      in a biological nurturing position. Two observers blind to the group assignment
      and the oxytocin dose analyzed the videotapes and assesed the newborn's state of 
      consciousness according to the Brazelton scale. RESULTS: The release of all
      rhythmic reflexes (p=0.01), the antigravity reflex (p=0.04), and total primitive 
      neonatal reflexes (p=0.02) in the group exposed to oxytocin was lower than in the
      group not exposed to oxytocin. No correlations were observed between the dose of 
      oxytocin administered and the percentage of primitive neonatal reflexes released 
      (r=0.03; p=0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Intrapartum oxytocin administration might inhibit 
      the expression of several primitive neonatal reflexes associated with
      breastfeeding. This correlation does not seem to be dose-dependent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactation is thought to buffer stress reactivity via oxytocin (OT).
      Dysregulation of the HPA axis has been reported in women with postpartum
      depression (PPD). The co-occurrence of PPD and lactation failure suggests that
      abnormalities in OT signaling may play a role in PPD. We hypothesized that
      abnormal OT signaling is implicated in dysregulated HPA axis reactivity among
      postpartum women with mood symptoms. In a prospective perinatal cohort, we tested
      associations between OT levels during breastfeeding and stress reactivity.
      METHODS: We recruited 52 pregnant women who intended to breastfeed, among whom 47
      underwent a standardized stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), at 8
      weeks postpartum. 39 were breastfeeding at time of TSST. We assessed mood
      symptoms using validated instruments and defined as symptomatic women with EPDS
      >/= 10 and/or Spielberger >/= 34. Following IV placement for blood draws, women
      breastfed their infants and then underwent the TSST. Mothers' hormone responses
      were quantified. RESULTS: Among symptomatic breastfeeding women (N=11;
      asymptomatic N=28), we found lower OT levels during breastfeeding (p<0.05) and
      higher CORT levels (p<0.05) both during breastfeeding and the TSST, as compared
      to asymptomatic breastfeeding women. In a mixed effects model examining CORT
      reactivity by symptom group and OT AUC, we observed a paradoxical response in
      symptomatic breastfeeding women during the TSST (group x time x OT AUC p<0.05);
      higher OT AUC was associated with higher CORT. CONCLUSIONS: In all breastfeeding 
      women, the surge of OT during feeding appears to buffer subsequent stress-induced
      CORT secretion. However, in symptomatic breastfeeding women, we found a positive 
      correlation between OT AUC and CORT, instead of the expected negative
      correlation, which we found among asymptomatic women.

AB  - Milk production in the nursing mother is induced by the hormone prolactin. Its
      release from the anterior pituitary is generally under tonic inhibition by
      neuroendocrine tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons of the arcuate nucleus.
      Successful nursing, however, requires not only production but also ejection of
      breast milk. This function is supported by the hormone oxytocin. Here we explored
      the possibility that interaction between these functionally complementary
      hormones is mediated by TIDA neurons. First, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
      were performed on prepubertal male rat hypothalamic slices, where TIDA neurons
      can be identified by a robust and rhythmic membrane potential oscillation.
      Oxytocin induced a switch of this rhythmic activity to tonic discharge through a 
      depolarization involving direct actions on TIDA neurons. The depolarization is
      sensitive to blockade of the oxytocin receptor and is mediated by a
      voltage-dependent inward current. This inward current has two components: a
      canonical transient receptor potential-like conductance in the low-voltage range,
      and in the high-voltage range, a Ca(2+)-dependent component. Finally, whole-cell 
      and loose-patch recordings were also performed on slices from virgin and
      lactating female rats to evaluate the relevance of these findings for nursing. In
      these preparations, oxytocin was found to excite TIDA neurons, identified by
      their expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. These findings suggest that oxytocin
      can modulate prolactin secretion by exciting TIDA neurons, and that this may
      serve as a feedforward inhibition of prolactin release.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This is an update of a 2008 Cochrane review. Breastfeeding is
      important. However, not all infants can feed at the breast and methods of
      expressing milk need evaluation. OBJECTIVES: To assess acceptability,
      effectiveness, safety, effect on milk composition, contamination and cost
      implications of methods of milk expression. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the
      Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2014), CINAHL
      (1982 to March 2014), conference proceedings, secondary references and contacted 
      researchers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing
      methods at any time after birth. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors
      independently assessed trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. MAIN
      RESULTS: This updated review includes 34 studies involving 1998 participants,
      with 17 trials involving 961 participants providing data for analysis. Eight
      studies compared one or more types of pump versus hand expression and 14 studies 
      compared one type of pump versus another type of pump, with three of these
      studies comparing both hand expression and multiple pump types. Fifteen studies
      compared a specific protocol or adjunct behaviour including sequential versus
      simultaneous pumping protocols (five studies), pumping > 4 times per day versus <
      3 times per day (one study), provision of a milk expression education and support
      intervention to mothers of preterm infants versus no provision (one study),
      provision of audio/visual relaxation to mothers of preterm infants versus no
      specific relaxation (two studies), commencing pumping within one hour of delivery
      versus between one to six hours (one study), breast massage before or during
      pumping versus no massage (two studies, of which one also tested a second
      behaviour), therapeutic touch versus none (one study), warming breasts before
      pumping versus not warming breasts (one study), combining hand expression with
      pumping versus pumping alone (one study) and a breast cleansing protocol versus
      no protocol (one study).There were insufficient comparable data on outcomes to
      undertake meta-analysis and data reported relates to evidence from single
      studies.Only one of the 17 studies examining maternal satisfaction/acceptability 
      provided data in a way that could be analysed, reporting that mothers assigned to
      the pumping group had more agreement with the statement 'I don't want anyone to
      see me pumping' than mothers in the hand expression group and the statement 'I
      don't want anyone to see me hand expressing' (n = 68, mean difference (MD) -0.70,
      95% confidence interval (CI) -1.25 to -0.15, P = 0.01), and that mothers found
      instructions for hand expression were clearer than for pumping (n = 68, MD 0.40, 
      95% CI 0.05 to 0.75, P = 0.02). No evidence of a difference was found between
      methods related to adverse effects of milk contamination (one study, n = 28, risk
      ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.27, P = 0.51), (one study, n = 142 milk
      samples, MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.58, P = 0.30), (one study, n = 123 milk
      samples, MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.49, P = 0.61), (one study, n = 141 milk
      samples, MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.26, P = 0.59 ); or level of maternal breast 
      or nipple pain or damage (one study, n = 68, MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.71, P =
      0.96).For the secondary outcomes, greater volume was obtained when mothers with
      infants in a neonatal unit were provided with a relaxation tape or
      music-listening interventions to use while pumping, when the breasts was warmed
      before pumping or massaged while pumping.Initiation of milk pumping within 60
      minutes of birth of a very low birthweight infant obtained higher mean milk
      quantity in the first week than the group who initiated pumping later. No
      evidence of difference in volume was found with simultaneous or sequential
      pumping or between pumps studied. Differences between methods was found for
      sodium, potassium, protein and fat constituents; no evidence of difference was
      found for energy content.No consistent effect was found related to prolactin
      change or effect on oxytocin release with pump type or method. Economic aspects
      were not reported.Most studies were classified as unclear or low risk of bias.
      Most studies did not provide any information regarding blinding of outcome
      assessment. Fifteen of the 25 studies that evaluated pumps or products had
      support from the manufacturers. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The most suitable method
      for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and
      the individual mother and infant. Low-cost interventions including early
      initiation when not feeding at the breast, listening to relaxation music, massage
      and warming of the breasts, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as
      effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. Small 
      sample sizes, large standard deviations, and the diversity of the interventions
      argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the 
      specific settings.

AB  - In mammals, some sites of specialized skin such as the palms, soles, and lips
      grow proportionally with the animal. However, other types of specialized skin
      such as the nipple and anal/genital region are dramatically altered with changes 
      of reproductive status. The specific cell types that mediate the growth of these 
      sites have not been identified. In the mouse, we observed a dramatic expansion of
      the specialized epidermis of the nipple, coupled to changes in connective tissue 
      and hair shaft density, which we designate as areola formation. During this
      process thymidine analog uptake was elevated in the epidermis and hair follicles.
      Although there were no changes in connective tissue cell proliferation, we did
      observe an altered expression of extracellular matrix genes. In addition, the
      fibroblasts of the virgin nipple areola and region showed increased transcript
      and protein levels for estrogen, progesterone, relaxin, and oxytocin relative to 
      those of ventral skin. To determine the role of pregnancy, lactation hormonal
      milieu, and localized mechanical strain on areola formation, we created models
      that separated these stimuli and evaluated changes in gross structure,
      proliferation and protein expression. While modest increases of epidermal
      proliferation and remodeling of connective tissue occurred as a result of
      individual stimuli, areola formation required exposure to pregnancy hormones, as 
      well as mechanical strain.

TI  - Suicide attempt and future risk of cancer: a nationwide cohort study in Sweden.
PG  - 501-9
LID - 10.1007/s10552-015-0528-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Little is known about cancer incidence among patients with a history of 
      suicide attempt. Suicide attempters have lower levels of oxytocin, a hormone
      related to lactation, stress, social functioning, and well-being, and recent
      research indicates influence on carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that the low
      oxytocin levels among suicide attempters results in an increased risk of cancer
      in general and in organs with oxytocin receptors in particular. METHODS: A
      nationwide cohort study of patients aged 15 years or older with hospitalization
      for self-inflicted injury or attempted suicide was identified from the Swedish
      patient register in 1968-2011. The cancer outcomes were identified from the
      Swedish cancer register. Cancer risk in suicide attempters was compared with the 
      risk in the background population of the corresponding age, sex, and calendar
      period by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95 % confidence
      intervals (95 % CI). RESULTS: The 186,627 patients (83,637 men and 102,990 women)
      hospitalized for self-inflicted injury or attempted suicide contributed with 2.6 
      million person-years at risk. The SIR for all cancer was 1.3 (95 % CI 1.27-1.33) 
      in men and 1.25 (1.22-1.28) in women. For cancers in organs rich in oxytocin
      receptors (uterus, breast, and brain), the corresponding SIRs were 1.02
      (0.87-1.19) and 1.13 (1.09-1.17), respectively. There was a particularly
      increased risk of cancers related to alcohol and tobacco in both sexes.
      CONCLUSION: Patients attempting suicide have an increased risk of cancer.
      However, this increase does not seem to be associated with low oxytocin levels,
      but rather to exposures like tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption.

TI  - Asynchronous milk ejection in human lactating breast: case series.
PG  - 254-9
LID - 10.1177/0890334414568120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Milk production is under the influence of autocrine control such that
      the rate of milk synthesis decreases as the breast fills with milk. Effective
      elimination of milk from the alveoli via the milk ejection reflex will therefore 
      result in increased milk synthesis. It has been assumed that milk ejection occurs
      in all alveoli simultaneously; however, animal studies have indicated that full
      alveoli eject milk sooner than less full alveoli, suggesting heterogeneous
      emptying of the mammary gland. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine 
      whether milk ejection occurs asynchronously in the human lactating breast.
      METHODS: Retrospective analysis of videos made of ultrasound monitoring of milk
      ducts during pumping. Six video clips (4 women) of ultrasound monitored milk
      ejections showed obvious differences in the timing of milk flow between different
      main milk ducts. Duct diameter was simultaneously measured every second in 2
      different ducts that drained 2 separate lobes of the breast. RESULTS: For 5 of 6 
      ultrasound duct monitoring sessions, both duct dilation and visualization of milk
      flow in the 2 separate main milk ducts differed by 2 to 8 seconds. For the
      remaining woman, milk was observed to eject from 1 part of the lobe, and when not
      removed, it flowed in a retrograde fashion into a different part of the lobe.
      CONCLUSION: Asynchrony of milk ejection occurs in the human lactating breast,
      suggesting that the timing of myoepithelial cell response differs, resulting in
      heterogeneous emptying of the gland.

TI  - Effects of different anesthesia protocols on lactation in the postpartum period.
PG  - 233-8
LID - 10.5152/jtgga.2014.14111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many factors can influence the secretion of breast milk. Cesarean
      section is a risk factor for late onset of breastfeeding. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      In our study, we compared the lactation process by mothers who underwent elective
      cesarean section under general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, epidural
      anesthesia, and normal birth; 84 patients between 18-40 years of age with a risk 
      of ASA I-II were included. Randomly patients were divided into four groups: group
      G (general anesthesia, n:21), group S (spinal anesthesia, n:21), group E
      (epidural anesthesia, n:21), and group V (vaginal birth, without anesthesia,
      n:21). Oxytocin and prolactin values of all patients before and after operation
      or birth were recorded. In addition the initiation time of lactation after
      delivery or cesarean section were recorded. RESULTS: In all groups, there were no
      significant differences among hormone levels in the prepartum period (p=0.350).
      Prolactin levels in group G (p=0.011) and oxytocin levels in group V (p=0.012) in
      the postpartum period were significantly higher than in the other groups. The
      start of lactation was significantly delayed in group G (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: We
      consider that the onset time of lactation is delayed in patients undergoing
      cesarean section with general anesthesia when compared with patients who undergo 
      cesarean section with spinal and epidural anesthesia and with patients who
      undergo normal vaginal birth. Because of the delay of awakening and recovery of
      cognitive functions in general anesthesia, communication between the mother and
      the newborn is delayed and so is the lactation.

TI  - Immortalization of normal human mammary epithelial cells in two steps by direct
      targeting of senescence barriers does not require gross genomic alterations.
PG  - 3423-35
LID - 10.4161/15384101.2014.954456 [doi]
AB  - Telomerase reactivation and immortalization are critical for human carcinoma
      progression. However, little is known about the mechanisms controlling this
      crucial step, due in part to the paucity of experimentally tractable model
      systems that can examine human epithelial cell immortalization as it might occur 
      in vivo. We achieved efficient non-clonal immortalization of normal human mammary
      epithelial cells (HMEC) by directly targeting the 2 main senescence barriers
      encountered by cultured HMEC. The stress-associated stasis barrier was bypassed
      using shRNA to p16(INK4); replicative senescence due to critically shortened
      telomeres was bypassed in post-stasis HMEC by c-MYC transduction. Thus, 2
      pathologically relevant oncogenic agents are sufficient to immortally transform
      normal HMEC. The resultant non-clonal immortalized lines exhibited normal
      karyotypes. Most human carcinomas contain genomically unstable cells, with
      widespread instability first observed in vivo in pre-malignant stages; in vitro, 
      instability is seen as finite cells with critically shortened telomeres approach 
      replicative senescence. Our results support our hypotheses that: (1)
      telomere-dysfunction induced genomic instability in pre-malignant finite cells
      may generate the errors required for telomerase reactivation and immortalization,
      as well as many additional "passenger" errors carried forward into resulting
      carcinomas; (2) genomic instability during cancer progression is needed to
      generate errors that overcome tumor suppressive barriers, but not required per
      se; bypassing the senescence barriers by direct targeting eliminated a need for
      genomic errors to generate immortalization. Achieving efficient HMEC
      immortalization, in the absence of "passenger" genomic errors, should facilitate 
      examination of telomerase regulation during human carcinoma progression, and
      exploration of agents that could prevent immortalization.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Oxytocin may play a role in pain modulation. The analgesic
      effects of breastfeeding with its associated endogenous oxytocin release have not
      been well investigated. To determine the impact of breastfeeding on incisional,
      perineal, and cramping pain after cesarean and vaginal delivery. DESIGN:
      Institutional review board-approved prospective observational study. SETTING:
      Labor and delivery and maternity wards. PATIENTS: Healthy (American Society of
      Anesthesiology physical statuses 1 and 2) multiparous women who had cesarean (n =
      40) and vaginal (n = 43) deliveries of singleton term infants and who were
      breastfeeding were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Women completed diaries to record
      incisional, perineal, or cramping pain scores 5 minutes before, during, and 5
      minutes after breastfeeding. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, obstetric, and neonatal
      variables, as well as analgesic use, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS: There was no
      difference in incisional pain before, during, and after breastfeeding in women
      post-cesarean delivery. Cramping pain was significantly increased during, as
      compared with before or after breastfeeding in both the vaginal (P < .001) and
      cesarean (P < .001) delivery cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: There was no analgesic effect 
      on incisional pain during breastfeeding, indicating that endogenous oxytocin
      associated with breastfeeding may not play a significant role in postpartum
      cesarean wound pain modulation. Breastfeeding increased cramping pain after
      vaginal and cesarean delivery. The increase in cramping pain is most likely due
      to the breastfeeding-associated oxytocin surge increasing uterine tone.

TI  - Breastfeeding experience differentially impacts recognition of happiness and
      anger in mothers.
PG  - 7006
LID - 10.1038/srep07006 [doi]
AB  - Breastfeeding is a dynamic biological and social process based on hormonal
      regulation involving oxytocin. While there is much work on the role of
      breastfeeding in infant development and on the role of oxytocin in
      socio-emotional functioning in adults, little is known about how breastfeeding
      impacts emotion perception during motherhood. We therefore examined whether
      breastfeeding influences emotion recognition in mothers. Using a dynamic emotion 
      recognition task, we found that longer durations of exclusive breastfeeding were 
      associated with faster recognition of happiness, providing evidence for a
      facilitation of processing positive facial expressions. In addition, we found
      that greater amounts of breastfed meals per day were associated with slower
      recognition of anger. Our findings are in line with current views of oxytocin
      function and support accounts that view maternal behaviour as tuned to prosocial 
      responsiveness, by showing that vital elements of maternal care can facilitate
      the rapid responding to affiliative stimuli by reducing importance of threatening
      stimuli.

TI  - [Pharmaceutical treatment of lactation deficiency lacks evidence].
PG  - V06130415
LID - V06130415 [pii]
AB  - In this review we have looked at the evidence for the pharmacological treatment
      of lactation deficiency. Five RCTs (n = 166) of metoclopramide found no effect on
      lactation and two RCTs (n = 26) of older date and lesser quality found
      significant effect. One RCT (n = 51) of syntocinon found no effect on lactation
      and two older RCTs (n = 60) of lesser quality found significant effect. Three
      RCTs (n = 105) found significant effect of domperidone on lactation. Education on
      breastfeeding is important to avoid the need for pharmacological treatment.

TI  - Active management of the third stage of labor may reduce breastfeeding duration
      due to pain and physical complications.
PG  - 494-502
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2014.0048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence is growing that active management of the third stage of
      labor using prophylactic uterotonics may be associated with lower breastfeeding
      rates. The reasons underlying this relationship are incompletely understood. The 
      aim of this article is to examine the experiences of mothers who stopped
      breastfeeding in relation to administration of parenteral uterotonics for
      postpartum hemorrhage prophylaxis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-eight
      mothers with an infant 0-6 months of age who had a vaginal birth completed a
      self-report questionnaire examining injections of uterotonics during the third
      stage of labor, breastfeeding at birth, breastfeeding duration, and, where
      applicable, reasons for breastfeeding cessation, whether physical, social, or
      psychological. RESULTS: No significant association was found between infant
      feeding mode at birth (breast/formula) and injection of uterotonics. However,
      mothers who had received uterotonics were significantly less likely to be
      breastfeeding at all at 2 and 6 weeks. Among mothers who had stopped
      breastfeeding, those who had received parenteral prophylactic uterotonics were
      significantly more likely to report stopping breastfeeding for physical reasons
      such as pain or difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that injection of
      prophylactic uteronics may reduce breastfeeding duration, but not initiation.
      This may be attributable to the effects of oxytocin or ergometrine on the
      physiology of lactation, leading to difficulties with infant latch and milk
      supply. If breastfeeding rates are to be optimized, this hypothesis needs to be
      explored in randomized controlled trials of third-stage management. Meanwhile,
      mothers who receive parenteral uterotonics may need additional support to
      establish breastfeeding.

TI  - Methodology and recruitment for a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the
      safety of wahakura for infant bedsharing.
PG  - 240
LID - 10.1186/1471-2431-14-240 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) has persistent high rates
      in deprived indigenous communities and much of this mortality is attributable to 
      unsafe sleep environments. Whilst health promotion worldwide has concentrated on 
      avoidance of bedsharing, the indigenous Maori community in New Zealand has
      reproduced a traditional flax bassinet (wahakura) designed to be used in ways
      that include bedsharing. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of
      this traditional sleeping device. METHODS/DESIGN: This two arm randomised
      controlled trial is being conducted with 200 mother-baby dyads recruited from
      Maori communities in areas of high deprivation in the Hawkes Bay, New Zealand.
      They are randomised to wahakura or bassinet use and investigation includes
      questionnaires at baseline (pregnancy), when baby is 1, 3, and 6 months, and an
      overnight video sleep study at 1 month with monitoring of baby temperature and
      oxygen saturation, and measurement of baby urinary cotinine and maternal salivary
      oxytocin. Outcome measures are amount of time head covered, amount of time in
      thermal comfort zone, number of hypoxic events, amount of time in the assigned
      sleep device, amount of time breastfeeding, number of parental (non-feed related)
      touching infant events, amount of time in the prone sleep position, the number of
      behavioural arousals and the amount of time infant is awake overnight. Survey
      data will compare breastfeeding patterns at 1, 3, and 6 months as well as data on
      maternal mind-mindedness, maternal wellbeing, attachment to baby, and maternal
      sleep patterns. DISCUSSION: Indigenous communities require creative SUDI
      interventions that fit within their prevailing world view. This trial, and its
      assessment of the safety of a wahakura relative to a standard bassinet, is an
      important contribution to the range of SUDI prevention research being undertaken 
      worldwide. TRIALS REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry:

TI  - Treatment of insufficient lactation is often not evidence-based.
PG  - A4869
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Breast milk has many advantages over formula for infants in
      developed and developing countries alike. Despite intentions of breastfeeding,
      some women develop insufficient lactation. Treatment options traditionally
      include breastfeeding education and pharmacotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An
      electronic questionnaire regarding treatment of insufficient lactation was sent
      to all obstetric departments (n = 21) and neonatal wards (n = 17) in Denmark.
      Three main questions were included which focused on: breastfeeding education for 
      women, use of pharmacotherapy and availability of local guidelines. RESULTS: In
      all, 30 out of a total of 38 departments participated; and among those, 93%
      offered some form of breastfeeding education. 50% used either metoclopramide or
      syntocinon to promote lactation. None used domperidone. 73% had a local clinical 
      guideline. 77% offered sessions with a lactation consultant. CONCLUSION: Despite 
      lack of evidence, half of the Danish obstetric departments and neonatal wards use
      metoclopramide and syntocinon for insufficient lactation. Domperidone might
      provide an alternative, but no departments reported its use. Management of
      insufficient lactation should always be initiated by counselling and education.
      Only when these treatment options are exhausted should pharmacotherapy with a
      suitable medication be considered.

LID - S1871-5192(14)00057-2 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of optimising maternal/baby psychophysiology has been 
      integrated into contemporary midwifery theories but not in the detail required to
      really understand the underpinning biological basis. METHOD: The functioning of
      the autonomic nervous system, as it relates to the uterus is reviewed. The
      physiology of myometrial cell contraction and relaxation is outlined. The main
      focus is on the factors that affect the availability and uptake of oxytocin and
      adrenaline/noradrenaline in the myometrial cells. These are the two key
      neuro-hormones, active in the 3rd and 4th stages of labour, that affect uterine
      contraction and retraction and therefore determine whether the woman will have an
      atonic PPH or not. DISCUSSION: The discussion explains and predicts the
      physiological functioning of the uterus during the 3rd and 4th stages of labour
      when skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding occurs and when it does not.
      CONCLUSION: This biologically based theory hypothesises that to achieve and
      maintain eutony and eulochia, midwives and birthing women should ensure early,
      prolonged and undisturbed skin-to-skin contact for mother and baby at birth
      including easy access for spontaneous breastfeeding.

TI  - [Oxytocin, the hormone that everyone uses and that few know].
PG  - 472-82
AB  - BACKGROUND. Oxytocin is a well known drug most commonly used in obstetrics for
      induction or augmentation of labor. Due to its essential role in labor, and the
      overall effect in the body, oxytocin must be deeply understood by all
      obstetricians who use it and prescribe it. There is relevant data listed about
      oxytocin and has reviewed the evidence in 31 full text articles of indexed
      journals between 1999 and 2013. In search engines like MEDLINE, MedicLatina,
      PUBMED, Wolters Kluwer Healt, with keywords like: oxytocin, oxytocin receptor,
      oxytocin vasopressin, oxytocin postpartum, oxytocin review, oxytocin labor,
      oxytocin release. The best evidence from the literature based on the methodology 
      they used is included. The word oxytocin comes from the Greek words omega Chi
      upsilon xi, tau omicron Chi omicron chi xi, which means "swift birth". It is
      synthesized in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypotalamus is
      mainly released from the neurohypophysis and nerve terminals. It travels from the
      brain to the heart and the whole body, activating or modulating a wide range of
      functions and emotions. Mainly cause myometrial contractions and myoepithelial
      cells of the breast for milk ejection. Its adverse effects are dose-related. No
      one knows exactly the minumum and maximum dose of oxytocin. More research is
      needed about central and peripheral receptors, coupled with the use to which they
      currently gives to agonists and antagonists of oxytocin and its receptor. As of
      2013, the documented adverse effects to date have been undervalued.

AB  - Mothers of preterm babies frequently have difficulty establishing or maintaining 
      lactation, thought to be due to interference with the milk ejection reflex.
      Administration of exogenous oxytocin can produce alveolar contraction and
      adequate breast emptying resulting in establishment of successful lactation. The 
      natural hormone oxytocin is not receptor-selective and may cause hyponatremia via
      V2 receptor mediated antidiuresis. We have designed a series of potent oxytocin
      analogues containing N-alkylglycines in position 7 with excellent selectivity
      versus the related V1a, V1b, and V2 vasopressin receptors and short half-life:
      agonists 31 ([2-ThiMeGly(7)]dOT), 47 (carba-6-[Phe(2),BuGly(7)]dOT), 55
      (carba-6-[3-MeBzlGly(7)]dOT), and 57 (carba-1-[4-FBzlGly(7)]dOT) have EC50 values
      at hOTR < 0.1 nM, selectivity ratios versus related human vasopressin receptors
      of >2000, IC50 at hV1aR > 500 nM, and total clearance in rats in the range of
      60-80 mL min(-1) kg(-1). Compound 57 (FE 202767) is currently in clinical
      development for the treatment of preterm mothers requiring lactation support.

AB  - This review focuses on the neuroendocrine mechanisms in the mother and the
      newborn that are involved in the generation and consolidation of mother-child
      attachment. The role that different hormones and neurotransmitters play on the
      regulation of these mechanisms during parturition, the immediate postpartum
      period and lactation is discussed. Interferences in the initiation of
      mother-child attachment may have potential long-term effects for the behavior and
      affection of the newborn. Therefore, the possible consequences of alterations in 
      the physiological neuroendocrine mechanisms of attachment, caused by elective
      Cesarean section, intrapartum hormonal manipulations, preterm delivery,
      mother-infant postpartum separation and bottle-feeding instead of breastfeeding
      are also discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between labor physiology and the onset of lactation
      leads to assess the potential correlation between oxytocin administration during 
      labor and duration of breast-feeding. METHODS: This study was designed as a
      retrospective cohort study where patients given synthetic oxytocin during labor
      induction were considered as the exposed cohort, and patients not given oxytocin 
      formed the non-exposed cohort. Four hundred of the 7465 children born at our
      maternity during 2006 were randomly selected. Information about breast-feeding
      was available for 316 of these children. Eventual confounding or adjustment
      factors were analyzed using stratified and multivariate analysis. RESULTS:
      Oxytocin was used for delivery of 189 (59.8%) newborns, multiplying the risk of
      bottle-feeding by 1.451 (95% CI 1.28-1.63). The best-fit regression model of
      oxytocin use effect on bottle-feeding included sex and gestational age of the
      newborn. The use of oxytocin also multiplies the risk of breast-feeding
      withdrawal at 3 months by 2.29 (95% CI 1.41-3.74). This effect is confounded by
      maternal age, being higher for mothers under 27 years. CONCLUSION: Oxytocin
      administration during labor had some impact on both onset and duration of
      breast-feeding, particularly in mothers under 27 years of age and newborns
      delivered at term. Clinical Study registered at U.S. NIH, ID: NCT01951040.

AB  - Oxytocin is a nine amino acid neuropeptide that is known to play a critical role 
      in fetal expulsion and breast-feeding, and has been recently implicated in
      mammalian social behavior. The actions of both central and peripheral oxytocin
      are mediated through the oxytocin receptor (Oxtr), which is encoded by a single
      gene. In contrast to the highly conserved expression of oxytocin in specific
      hypothalamic nuclei, the expression of its receptor in the brain is highly
      diverse among different mammalian species or even within individuals of the same 
      species. The diversity in the pattern of brain Oxtr expression among mammals is
      thought to contribute to the broad range of social systems and organizations.
      Yet, the mechanisms underlying this diversity are poorly understood. DNA
      methylation is a major epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene transcription,
      and has been linked to reduced expression levels of the Oxtr in individuals with 
      autism. Here we hypothesize that DNA methylation is involved in the expression
      regulation of Oxtr in the mouse brain. By combining bisulfite DNA conversion and 
      Next-Generation Sequencing we found that specific CpG sites are differentially
      methylated between distinct brain regions expressing different levels of Oxtr
      mRNA. Some of these CpG sites are located within putative binding sites of
      transcription factors known to regulate Oxtr expression, including estrogen
      receptor alpha (ERalpha) and SP1. Specifically, methylation of the SP1 site was
      found to positively correlate with Oxtr expression. Furthermore, we revealed that
      the methylation levels of these sites in the various brain regions predict the
      relationship between ERalpha and Oxtr mRNA levels. Collectively, our results
      suggest that brain region-specific expression of the mouse Oxtr gene is
      epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation of its promoter.

TI  - Oxytocin and Epstein-Barr virus: Stress biomarkers in the postpartum period among
      first-time mothers from Sao Paulo, Brazil.
PG  - 43-50
LID - 10.1002/ajhb.22489 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between
      self-reported stress levels among new mothers in Sao Paulo, Brazil and two
      biomarkers of stressful experience, oxytocin (OT) and Epstein-Barr Virus antibody
      level (EBV-ab), with planned pregnancy hypothesized as a moderator of biological 
      response to stressful conditions. METHODS: Sixty-three first-time mothers between
      the ages of 15 and 45 were recruited from neighborhoods in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
      Quantitative and qualitative data were collected longitudinally, bi-weekly
      between two and 12 weeks postpartum. OT level was assessed from breast milk
      samples and EBV-ab from blood spot samples. An Interpersonal Satisfaction scale
      was developed, validated, and administered, along with the Cohen perceived stress
      scale (PSS). RESULTS: In-depth interview data revealed unplanned pregnancy to be 
      a significant stressor in the lives of first-time mothers. In linear regression, 
      OT level was negatively associated with interpersonal satisfaction score (P =
      0.022) and positively associated with PSS score (P = 0.007). When splitting the
      sample by planned status of the pregnancy, women with an unplanned pregnancy
      showed a strengthened positive association between OT level and PSS (P = 0.001;
      Adj R(2) = 0.44) and negative association with interpersonal satisfaction (P =
      0.017; Adj R(2) = 0.15), while no associations existed for women with a planned
      pregnancy. EBV-ab level was not correlated or associated with stress/satisfaction
      measures. CONCLUSION: OT is an effective biomarker in the measurement of stress
      in the body, and additionally reflects differential experiences with difficult
      interpersonal circumstances, such as unplanned pregnancy. By contrast, EBV-ab
      failed to reflect differences in self-reported stress levels between mothers.

AB  - Vertebrate species from fish to humans engage in a complex set of preparatory
      behaviors referred to as nesting; yet despite its phylogenetic ubiquity, the
      physiological and neural mechanisms that underlie nesting are not well known. We 
      here test the hypothesis that nesting behavior is influenced by the
      vasopressin-oxytocin (VP-OT) peptides, based upon the roles they play in parental
      behavior in mammals. We quantified nesting behavior in male and female zebra
      finches following both peripheral and central administrations of OT and V1a
      receptor (OTR and V1aR, respectively) antagonists. Peripheral injections of the
      OTR antagonist profoundly reduce nesting behavior in females, but not males,
      whereas comparable injections of V1aR antagonist produce relatively modest
      effects in both sexes. However, central antagonist infusions produce no effects
      on nesting, and OTR antagonist injections into the breast produce significantly
      weaker effects than those into the inguinal area, suggesting that antagonist
      effects are mediated peripherally, likely via the oviduct. Finally,
      immunocytochemistry was used to quantify nesting-induced Fos activation of
      nonapeptide neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the
      hypothalamus and the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Nest-building
      induced Fos expression within paraventricular VP neurons of females but not
      males. Because the avian forms of OT (Ile(8)-OT; mesotocin) and VP (Ile(3)-VP;
      vasotocin) exhibit high affinity for the avian OTR, and because both peptide
      forms modulate uterine contractility, we hypothesize that nesting-related stimuli
      induce peptide release from paraventricular vasotocin neurons, which then promote
      female nesting via peripheral feedback from OTR binding in the oviduct uterus.

TI  - Non-hormonal methods for induction of labour.
PG  - 441-7
LID - 10.1097/GCO.0000000000000027 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The percentage of induced live birth has more than doubled
      from the 1990s to 2008. Induction of labour can either be based on medical
      indications, or performed as an elective procedure. A large range of
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities are available for the
      induction of labour and the optimal method for labour induction is unknown. This 
      article is aimed to examine literature on non-hormonal methods for labour
      induction, published from January 2012 to May 2013. RECENT FINDINGS: Eleven
      studies were identified in our search and included into the review. Foley balloon
      catheter appears to be more cost-effective and commonly used non-hormonal
      technique for induction of labour, although further meta-analysis is required in 
      this area. Currently, there is not enough evidence to support routine use in all 
      women for labour induction among other methods including amniotomy, acupuncture, 
      sexual intercourse, isosorbide mononitrate, hypnosis, castor oil and breast
      stimulation. The latest three studies suggest that amniotomy may increase need
      for oxytocin augmentation during labour induction. SUMMARY: Many non-hormonal
      methods for labour induction still require further evidence to support their use 
      within the clinical setting. Balloon catheter seems to be a more widely accepted 
      non-hormonal method that has been supported by various literatures.

TI  - Synthetic oxytocin and breastfeeding: reasons for testing an hypothesis.

AB  - Synthetic oxytocin is widely used in developed countries and in emerging
      countries as well. It is the most common medical intervention in childbirth. A
      great variety of side effects are plausible. There are in particular theoretical 
      reasons to test the hypothesis that the increasing incidence of breastfeeding
      difficulties and the frequent earlier than desired cessation of breastfeeding are
      related to the use of synthetic oxytocin during labour. There have already been
      some studies that tend to support this hypothesis. Four hundred of the 7465
      children born in 2006 at the Carlos Haya University Hospital (Malaga, Spain) were
      randomly selected. By interviewing the mothers, information about feeding type
      and duration was obtained in 2011 for 316 children. Among the 189 children who
      were born after labours induced or augmented with synthetic oxytocin, the odds
      ratio for bottle-feeding was 1.451 and the odds ratio for withdrawal at 3 months 
      was 2.294. In addition, the Battelle Developmental Inventory was used to assess
      at age five 148 children (84 born with synthetic oxytocin): the odds ratio for
      neuropsychological development disorders after use of oxytocin was 1.46. The main
      limitation of such a preliminary study is that in the context of a tertiary
      Spanish hospital the possible effects of synthetic oxytocin on the quality and
      duration of breastfeeding cannot be easily dissociated from the effects of other 
      components of pharmacological assistance during labour, particularly epidural
      fentanyl (a synthetic opioid analgesic). This comment is valid for all studies
      exploring the side effects of synthetic oxytocin in obstetric units of developed 
      countries, including explorations through videotapes of the effects of synthetic 
      oxytocin on primitive neonatal reflexes. It is also valid for studies exploring
      the side effects of obstetric analgesia without taking into account the use of
      synthetic oxytocin. This is why we underline the importance of conducting such
      studies in emerging countries (e.g. China and Brazil) where synthetic oxytocin is
      widely used while there are no epidural services. Studies of oxytocin given
      electively at the onset of third stage of labour (after the birth of the neonate)
      should help to interpret possible effects on the quality and duration of
      breastfeeding.

      postpartum depression and breastfeeding duration.
PG  - 681-94

AB  - Mothers vary in duration of breastfeeding. These individual differences are
      related to a variety of demographic and individual maternal factors including
      maternal hormones, mood and early experiences. However, little is known about the
      role of genetic factors. We studied single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
      OXT peptide gene (rs2740210; rs4813627) and the OXT receptor gene (OXTR rs237885)
      in two samples of mothers from the Maternal adversity, Vulnerability and
      Neurodevelopment study (MAVAN), a multicenter (Hamilton and Montreal, Canada)
      study following mothers and their children from pregnancy until 7 years of age.
      Data from the Hamilton site was the primary sample (n = 201) and data from
      Montreal was the replication sample (n = 151). Breastfeeding duration, maternal
      mood (measured by the CES-D scale) and early life adversity (measured by the CTQ 
      scale) were established during 12 months postpartum. In our primary sample,
      polymorphisms in OXT rs2740210, but not the other SNPs, interacted with early
      life adversity to predict variation in breastfeeding duration (overall F8,125 =
      2.361, P = 0.021; interaction effect b = -8.12, t = -2.3, P = 0.023) and
      depression (overall F8,118 = 5.751, P </= 0.001; interaction effect b = 6.06, t =
      3.13, P = 0.002). A moderated mediation model showed that higher levels of
      depression mediated the inverse relation of high levels of early life adversity
      to breastfeeding duration, but only in women possessing the CC genotype [effect
      a' = -3.3401, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -7.9466 to -0.0015] of the OXT SNP
      and not in women with the AA/AC genotype (a' = -1.2942, ns). The latter findings 
      (moderated mediation model) were replicated in our Montreal sample (a' = -0.277, 
      95% CI = -0.7987 to -0.0348 for CC; a' = -0.1820, ns for AA/AC).

TI  - Association between maternal mood and oxytocin response to breastfeeding.
PG  - 352-61
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2012.3768 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression is associated with reduced breastfeeding
      duration. We previously hypothesized that shared neuroendocrine mechanisms
      underlie this association. We sought to measure the association between maternal 
      mood and neuroendocrine response to breastfeeding. METHODS: We conducted a
      longitudinal cohort study of women recruited during pregnancy who intended to
      breastfeed. Baseline depression and anxiety history were assessed with a
      structured clinical interview. We measured mood symptoms using validated
      psychometric instruments, and we quantified affect and neuroendocrine responses
      to breastfeeding during laboratory visits at 2 and 8 weeks postpartum. RESULTS:
      We recruited 52 women who intended to breastfeed, among whom 47 completed 8-week 
      follow-up. Duration and intensity of breastfeeding through 8 weeks were similar
      among mothers with lower versus higher anxiety and depression scores. In the
      third trimester, oxytocin was inversely correlated with Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale (EPDS) score (p=0.03). We did not find differences in
      neuroendocrine profile during breastfeeding at 2 weeks postpartum. Among the 39
      women who breastfed at 8 weeks postpartum, oxytocin area under the curve during
      breastfeeding was inversely correlated with maternal EPDS and STAI-State and
      STAI-Trait anxiety scores (all p</=0.01). Higher anxiety and depression scores
      was further associated with lower oxytocin (group p<0.05) during feeding. During 
      feeding at both visits, higher anxiety and depression scores were also associated
      with more negative affect: mothers reported feeling less happy and more
      depressed, overwhelmed, and stressed during feeding than women with lower scores.
      CONCLUSION: Symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with differences
      in oxytocin response and affect during breastfeeding.

AB  - Our recent findings of a weaning-related pattern of oxytocin (OT) and OT receptor
      (OTR) expression in the rat enteric nervous system and in villus-crypt
      enterocytes, together with the known high level and stability of OT in breast
      milk support that OT may play a role in gut function and development. We
      previously described a biphasic dose-response of the PI3K/Akt pathway in gut
      cells treated with OT. Activation peaked at 62.5 nM OT (30 min) and coincided
      with OTR internalization. Here we use automated Western blotting to further
      explore OT-elicited changes in Akt and pAkt(T308), as well as in downstream
      substrates p70 S6 kinase-1 (S6K1) and eIF-4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Relative
      to fresh growth medium (FGM) alone, our results showed OT in FGM reduced the
      abundance and phosphorylation of S6K1 and the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, both
      substrates of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Phosphorylation
      of mTORC1 regulator, Raptor(S792), was increased by high and low OT
      concentrations, with predicted inhibitory effects on mTORC1. OT thus
      downregulates anabolic effects induced by FGM activity catalyzed by mTORC1. OT is
      a regulator of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway in Caco2BB cells and may modulate
      translation in gut cells.

TI  - Depression, sleep quality, and maternal well-being in postpartum women with a
      history of sexual assault: a comparison of breastfeeding, mixed-feeding, and
      formula-feeding mothers.
PG  - 16-22
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2012.0024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with a history of sexual assault are at increased risk for
      sleep difficulties and depression in their first year of motherhood.
      Breastfeeding improves sleep parameters and lowers risk of depression for women
      in general. However, it is unknown whether breastfeeding is related to maternal
      depression, sleep quality, and maternal well-being in sexual assault survivors.
      We examined the association between sexual assault and several indices of sleep, 
      depression, and maternal well-being in a large sample of sexual assault survivors
      in the first year postpartum. We also explored whether feeding method was related
      to our outcome variables for both sexually assaulted and non-assaulted women.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A sample of 6,410 mothers of infants 0-12 months old
      participated in the online Survey of Mothers' Sleep and Fatigue; 994 women had a 
      history of sexual assault. RESULTS: As predicted, women with a history of sexual 
      assault had a number of sleep difficulties, increased risk of depression, and
      overall poorer subjective well-being than their non-assaulted counterparts.
      However, sexual assault survivors who were breastfeeding were at lower risk on
      all of the sleep and depression parameters than sexual assault survivors who were
      mixed or formula feeding. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual assault has a pervasive negative
      effect on new mothers' sleep quality and risk of depression. However, these
      negative effects were less severe for the breastfeeding mothers than they were
      for the mixed- or formula-feeding mothers.

AB  - In comparison with the vast epidemiological literature on postpartum depression
      (PPD), relatively few studies have examined the biological aspects of the
      disorder. However, research into the biological mechanisms of PPD is a
      challenging task, as normal pregnancy and the postpartum period cause adaptive
      endocrine changes, which would otherwise be considered pathological in
      nonpregnant women. This review focuses on the adaptive changes of childbearing
      and nursing, which ultimately may put women at increased risk of PPD. In light of
      the normal physiology, the authors also attempt to describe the current evidence 
      of the biological changes associated with the development of depression in the
      postpartum period, including ovarian steroids, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      axis, the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, the thyroid system and
      inflammatory markers. In addition, current knowledge on candidate genes
      associated with PPD is reviewed.

TI  - The use of galactogogues in the breastfeeding mother.
PG  - 1392-404
LID - 10.1345/aph.1R167 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review data regarding the efficacy of galactogogues available in
      the US to increase breast milk production in postpartum mothers. DATA SOURCES:
      Literature was sought using PubMed (1966-June 2012) and EMBASE (1973-June 2012). 
      Search terms included breastfeeding, breast milk, lactation, galactogogue,
      metoclopramide, oxytocin, fenugreek, milk thistle, silymarin, growth hormone,
      thyroid releasing hormone, medroxyprogesterone, domperidone, goat's rue, beer,
      Asparagus racemosus, shatavari, Medicago sativa, alfalfa, Onicus benedictus,
      blessed thistle, Galega officinalis, brewer's yeast, and herbals. STUDY SELECTION
      AND DATA EXTRACTION: All studies including humans and published in English with
      data assessing the efficacy of galactogogues for increasing breast milk
      production were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Breast milk is considered the optimal 
      food source for newborns through 1 year of age. Many factors influence overall
      maternal production, including maternal pain, illness, balance of time when
      returning to work, anxiety, or emotional stress. Although a variety of herbal and
      pharmaceutical options have anecdotal evidence of their ability to improve breast
      milk production, peer-reviewed studies proving their efficacy are lacking.
      Metoclopramide, oxytocin, fenugreek, and milk thistle have shown mixed results in
      improving milk production; however, the trials were small and had a variety of
      limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Nonpharmacologic recommendations should be exhausted
      before adding therapy. Although anecdotal evidence encourages the use of
      metoclopramide, fenugreek, asparagus, and milk thistle for their galactogogue
      properties, efficacy and safety data in the literature are lacking. Oxytocin and 
      domperidone are potentially available for compounding purposes, but safety data
      are limited. More studies are needed to evaluate the effects of available
      galactogogues on breast milk production.

TI  - Enhancing breast milk production with Domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates 
      (EMPOWER trial).
PG  - 87
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-12-87 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of mother's own breast milk during initial hospitalization
      has a positive impact not only in reducing potential serious neonatal morbidities
      but also contribute to improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes. Mothers of
      very preterm infants struggle to maintain a supply of breast milk during their
      infants' prolonged hospitalization. Galactogogues are medications that induce
      lactation by exerting its effects through oxytocin or prolactin enhancement.
      Domperidone is a potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonist which stimulates the
      release of prolactin. Small trials have established its ability in enhancing
      breast milk production. EMPOWER was designed to determine the safety and efficacy
      of domperidone in mothers experiencing an inadequate milk supply. METHODS/DESIGN:
      EMPOWER is a multicenter, double masked, randomized controlled phase-II trial to 
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of domperidone in those mothers identified 
      as having difficulty in breast milk production. Eligible mothers will be
      randomized to one of two allocated groups: Group A: domperidone 10 mg orally
      three times daily for 28 days; and Group B: identical placebo 10 mg orally three 
      times daily for 14 days followed by domperidone 10 mg orally three times daily
      for 14 days. The primary outcome will be determined at the completion of the
      first 2-week period; the second 2-week period will facilitate answering the
      secondary questions regarding timing and duration of treatment. To detect an
      estimated 30% change between the two groups (from 40% to 28%, corresponding to an
      odds ratio of 0.6), a total sample size of 488 mothers would be required at 80%
      power and alpha=0.05. To account for a 15% dropout, this number is increased to
      560 (280 per group). The duration of the trial is expected to be 36-40 months.
      DISCUSSION: The use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice for
      mothers in the presence of insufficient breast milk production, particularly when
      the other techniques are unsuccessful. EMPOWER is designed to provide valuable
      information in guiding the practices for this high-risk group of infants and
      mothers. The results of this trial will also inform both mothers and clinicians
      about the choices available to increase and maintain sufficient breast milk.

TI  - Alternative versus conventional institutional settings for birth.
PG  - CD000012
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD000012.pub4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alternative institutional settings have been established for the care
      of pregnant women who prefer little or no medical intervention. The settings may 
      offer care throughout pregnancy and birth, or only during labour; they may be
      part of hospitals or freestanding entities. Specially designed labour rooms
      include bedroom-like rooms, ambient rooms, and Snoezelen rooms. OBJECTIVES:
      Primary: to assess the effects of care in an alternative institutional birth
      environment compared to care in a conventional setting. Secondary: to determine
      if the effects of birth settings are influenced by staffing, architectural
      features, organizational models or geographical location. SEARCH METHODS: We
      searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 March 
      2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials
      which compared the effects of an alternative institutional birth setting to a
      conventional setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methods 
      of the Cochrane Collaboration Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Two review authors 
      evaluated methodological quality. We performed double data extraction and
      presented results using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN 
      RESULTS: Ten trials involving 11,795 women met the inclusion criteria. We found
      no trials of freestanding birth centres or Snoezelen rooms. Allocation to an
      alternative setting increased the likelihood of: no intrapartum
      analgesia/anesthesia (six trials, n = 8953; RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.33);
      spontaneous vaginal birth (eight trials; n = 11,202; RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to
      1.05); breastfeeding at six to eight weeks (one trial, n = 1147; RR 1.04, 95% CI 
      1.02 to 1.06); and very positive views of care (two trials, n = 1207; RR 1.96,
      95% CI 1.78 to 2.15). Allocation to an alternative setting decreased the
      likelihood of epidural analgesia (eight trials, n = 10.931; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74 
      to 0.87); oxytocin augmentation of labour (eight trials, n = 11,131; RR 0.77, 95%
      CI 0.67 to 0.88); instrumental vaginal birth (eight trials, n = 11,202; RR 0.89, 
      95% CI 0.79 to 0.99), and episiotomy (eight trials, n = 11,055; RR 0.83, 95% CI
      0.77 to 0.90). There was no apparent effect on other adverse maternal or neonatal
      outcomes. Care by the same or separate staff had no apparent effects. No
      conclusions could be drawn regarding the effects of continuity of caregiver or
      architectural characteristics. In several of the trials included in this review, 
      the design features of the alternative setting were confounded by important
      differences in the organizational models for care (separate staff for the
      alternative setting, offering more continuity of caregiver), and thus it is
      difficult to draw inferences about the independent effects of the physical birth 
      environment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hospital birth centres are associated with
      lower rates of medical interventions during labour and birth and higher levels of
      satisfaction, without increasing risk to mothers or babies.

AB  - The aim of experiments was to characterize the neurons of the autonomic chain
      that innervates the nipple and the mammary gland of lactating rats using
      retrograde transynaptic virus labeling and neurotransmitter and neuropeptide
      immunohistochemistry. Two days after injection of green fluorescence protein
      labeled virus in two nipples and underlying mammary glands, labeling was observed
      in the ipsilateral paravertebral sympathetic trunk and the lateral horn. Three
      days after inoculation the labeling appeared in the brain stem and the
      hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Above the spinal cord the labeling was
      bilateral. A subpopulation of virus labeled cells in the paraventricular nuclei
      synthesized oxytocin. Labeled neurons in the lateral horn showed cholinergic
      immunoreactivity. These cholinergic neurons innervated the paravertebral ganglia 
      where the virus labeled neurons were partially noradrenergic. The noradrenergic
      fibers in the mammary gland innervate the smooth muscle wall of vessels, but not 
      the mammary gland in rats. The neurons in the lateral horn receive afferents from
      the brain stem, and paraventricular nucleus and these afferents are noradrenergic
      and oxytocinergic. New findings in our work: Some oxytocinergic fibers may
      descend to the neurons of the lateral horn which innervate noradrenergic neurons 
      in the paravertebral sympathetic trunk, and in turn these noradrenergic neurons
      reach the vessels of the mammary gland.

AB  - Breastfeeding benefits both infant and maternal health. Use of epidural
      anesthesia during labor is increasingly common and may interfere with
      breastfeeding. Studies analyzing epidural anesthesia's association with
      breastfeeding outcomes show mixed results; many have methodological flaws. We
      analyzed potential associations between epidural anesthesia and overall
      breast-feeding cessation within 30 days postpartum while adjusting for standard
      and novel covariates and uniquely accounting for labor induction. A pooled
      analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves and modified Cox Proportional Hazard models
      included 772 breastfeeding mothers from upstate New York who had vaginal term
      births of healthy singleton infants. Subjects were drawn from two cohort studies 
      (recruited postpartum between 2005 and 2008) and included maternal self-report
      and maternal and infant medical record data. Analyses of potential associations
      between epidural anesthesia and overall breastfeeding cessation within 1 month
      included additional covariates and uniquely accounted for labor induction. After 
      adjusting for standard demographics and intrapartum factors, epidural anesthesia 
      significantly predicted breastfeeding cessation (hazard ratio 1.26 [95%
      confidence interval 1.10, 1.44], p < 0.01) as did hospital type, maternal age,
      income, education, planned breastfeeding goal, and breastfeeding confidence. In
      post hoc analyses stratified by Baby Friendly Hospital (BFH) status, epidural
      anesthesia significantly predicted breastfeeding cessation (BFH: 1.19 [1.01,
      1.41], p < 0.04; non-BFH: 1.65 [1.31, 2.08], p < 0.01). A relationship between
      epidural anesthesia and breastfeeding was found but is complex and involves
      institutional, clinical, maternal and infant factors. These findings have
      implications for clinical care and hospital policies and point to the need for
      prospective studies.

AB  - AIM: To determine factors associated with extreme hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates
      at the University Hospital of the West Indies. METHODS: A retrospective review of
      all neonates with hyperbilirubinaemia requiring medical intervention at the
      University Hospital of the West Indies between 1 January 2006 and 30 June 2007
      was performed. Factors associated with extreme hyperbilirubinaemia were
      determined using multiple logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 170
      neonates fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the study and 15 (9%) of them had
      extreme hyperbilirubinaemia. The majority (97, 57%) were term infants and 103
      (61%) were male. Exclusively breastfed neonates were more likely to have extreme 
      hyperbilirubinaemia (OR 2.6, 95% CI 0.01-0.6). Neonates whose mothers received
      oxytocin during labour (OR 2.7, 95% CI 0.02-0.3) and those who were
      G6PD-deficient (OR 2.6, 95% CI 0.01-0.5) were more likely to have extreme
      hyperbilurubinaemia. CONCLUSION: Exclusive breastfeeding, oxytocin use in the
      mother during labour and G6PD deficiency in the infant were found to be factors
      associated with extreme hyperbilirubinaemia.

PG  - 396-404
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0b013e318257fac3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of breastfeeding with maternal sensitive
      responsiveness and infant-mother attachment security and disorganization.
      METHODS: We included 675 participants of a prospective cohort study.
      Questionnaires about breastfeeding practices were administered at 2 and 6 months 
      postpartum. At 14 months, maternal sensitive responsiveness was assessed in a
      13-minute laboratory procedure using Ainsworth's sensitivity scales, and
      attachment quality was assessed with the Strange Situation Procedure. Mothers
      were genotyped for oxytocin receptor genes OXTR rs53576 and OXTR rs2254298.
      Linear regressions and analyses of covariance adjusted for various background
      variables were conducted. We tested for mediation and moderation by maternal
      sensitive responsiveness and maternal oxytocin receptor genotype. RESULTS:
      Continuous analyses showed that longer duration of breastfeeding was associated
      with more maternal sensitive responsiveness (B = 0.11, 95% confidence interval
      [CI] 0.02; 0.20, p < .05), more attachment security (B = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.02;
      0.46, p < .05), and less attachment disorganization (B = -0.20, 95% CI -0.36;
      -0.03, p < .05). Duration of breastfeeding was not related to the risk of
      insecure-avoidant or insecure-resistant versus secure attachment classification, 
      but longer duration of breastfeeding predicted a lower risk of disorganized
      versus secure attachment classification (n = 151; odds ratio [OR] = 0.81, 95% CI 
      0.66 to 0.99, p = .04). Maternal sensitive responsiveness did not mediate the
      associations, and maternal oxytocin receptor genotype was not a significant
      moderator. CONCLUSIONS: Although duration of breastfeeding was not associated
      with differences in infant-mother attachment classifications, we found subtle
      positive associations between duration of breastfeeding and sensitive
      responsiveness, attachment security, and disorganization.

TI  - The effect of combination treatment with trenbolone acetate and estradiol-17beta 
      on skeletal muscle expression and plasma concentrations of oxytocin in sheep.
PG  - 67-73
LID - 10.1016/j.domaniend.2012.02.004 [doi]
AB  - Implantation of trenbolone acetate (TBA) in conjunction with estradiol-17beta
      (E(2)) increases growth, feed conversion efficiency, and carcass leanness in
      cattle. Our previous study in Brahman steers suggested that the neuropeptide
      hormone oxytocin (OXT) may be involved in increasing muscle growth after TBA-E(2)
      treatment. The present study aimed to determine whether OXT mRNA expression in
      the longissimus muscle (LM) is also up-regulated in TBA-E(2-)implanted wethers as
      has been found in steers. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to measure the
      expression of the gene encoding the OXT precursor, three genes with increased
      expression in the LM muscle of TBA-E(2)-treated steers, MYOD1 (muscle
      transcription factor), GREB1 (growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1), 
      and WISP2 (Wnt-1 inducible signaling pathway protein 2), and two genes encoding
      IGF pathway proteins, IGF1, IGFR, in the LM of both untreated and
      TBA-E(2)-treated wethers. The expression of OXT mRNA in wethers that received the
      TBA-E(2) treatment was increased ~4.4-fold (P = 0.01). TBA-E(2) treatment also
      induced a 2.3-fold increase in circulating OXT (P = 0.001). These data, together 
      with the observation that untreated wethers had much higher baseline
      concentrations of circulating OXT than previously observed in steers, suggest
      that wethers and steers have quite different OXT hormone systems. TBA-E(2)
      treatment had no effect on the expression of IGF1, IGFR, and the muscle
      regulatory gene MYOD1 mRNA levels in wethers (P >/= 0.15), but there was an
      increase in the expression of the two growth-related genes, GREB1 (P = 0.001) and
      WISP2 (P = 0.04). Both genes are common gene targets for both the estrogen and
      androgen signaling pathways. Consequently, their actions may contribute to the
      positive interaction between TBA and E(2) on additive improvements on muscle
      growth.

TI  - Newborn feeding behaviour depressed by intrapartum oxytocin: a pilot study.
PG  - 749-54
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2012.02668.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect intrapartum oxytocin administration can have on
      Primitive Neonatal Reflexes. The secondary objective was to observe the influence
      of intrapartum oxytocin may have on breastfeeding. METHODS: Twenty healthy
      primiparae with a single gestation at term were included. To assess Primitive
      Neonatal Reflexes, video film was taken during an experimental situation designed
      to elicit Primitive Neonatal Reflexes. Three independent observers blinded to the
      oxytocin dose that had been administered coded the Primitive Neonatal Reflexes.
      Data regarding breastfeeding were collected by telephone at 3 months. RESULTS:
      Medium oxytocin dose was 1931.9 +/- 1754.4 mUI. A Kappa index >0.75 was obtained 
      for four Primitive Neonatal Reflexes: swallow, jaw jerk, suck and gazing. A
      negative association was found between oxytocin dose and sucking (p = 0.03). At 3
      months of life, women exclusively breastfeeding (63.1%) had received a
      significantly lower average dose of oxytocin than those not exclusively
      breastfeeding (36.8%) (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, intrapartum
      exogenous oxytocin seems to disturb sucking and breastfeeding duration. Further
      studies are required to confirm these results and to ascertain whether there
      could be other effects of intrapartum oxytocin on newborn behaviour.

TI  - Influence of common birth interventions on maternal blood pressure patterns
      during breastfeeding 2 days after birth.
PG  - 93-9
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2010.0099 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated possible influences of medical interventions
      during labor on maternal blood pressure during a breastfeed 2 days postpartum.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six primiparae with normal deliveries were
      consecutively recruited. Blood pressure was measured at -5, 10, 30, and 60
      minutes during a morning breastfeed 2 days postpartum. Five treatment groups were
      formed based on the medical interventions received during labor: Non-medicated
      mothers (Control group, n=21); mothers receiving epidural analgesia (EDA) with
      oxytocin (OT) stimulation (EDA(OT) group, n=14); mothers receiving EDA without OT
      stimulation (EDA(non-OT) group, n=7); mothers receiving OT stimulation only (OT
      intravenously [iv] group, n=9); and mothers receiving 10 IU of OT intramuscularly
      (im) only (OT im group, n=15). RESULTS: Baseline diastolic, but not systolic,
      blood pressure differed between the groups as displayed by significantly lower
      diastolic blood pressure in the EDA(non-OT) group compared with the Control
      group, the OT iv group, and the EDA(OT) group (p=0.045, p=0.041, and p=0.024,
      respectively). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell significantly
      during the breastfeeding session in the Control group (p=0.001 and p=0.004,
      respectively), the OT im group (p=0.006 and p=0.001, respectively), and the
      EDA(OT) group (p=0.028 and p=0.002, respectively), and the fall in diastolic
      blood pressure tended to be significant in the OT iv group (p=0.050). The
      duration of skin-to-skin contact before breastfeeding correlated positively with 
      the decrease in systolic blood pressure in the OT im group (R(s)=0.540, p=0.046).
      CONCLUSION: Administration of EDA during labor lowers baseline diastolic blood
      pressure and abolishes the fall in blood pressure in response to a breastfeed 2
      days after birth.

      and early breastfeeding.

LID - 10.1089/bfm.2011.0099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of epidural analgesia on labor and effective breastfeeding
      is still being debated. The aim of this study is to define its impact on the
      trend of labor, the newborns' well-being, and early breastfeeding. METHODS: We
      considered first-term physiologic pregnant women who delivered by the vaginal
      route. We divided them into two groups: group A received epidural analgesia
      during labor, whereas group B received no analgesia. We recorded maternal age,
      gestational age, modality of delivery, length of labor, and length of active
      labor. All newborns received skin-to-skin contact; early breastfeeding was
      encouraged. We recorded data on birth weight and length, Apgar score at minutes 1
      and 5, type of crying, neonatal reactivity, and time between birth and exposure
      to the breast. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05. RESULTS: Of
      934 pregnant women who delivered by the vaginal route, 317 patients required
      labor analgesia, and 245 patients agreed to participate in our study. Only 128
      patients met inclusion criteria. We randomized them in 64 women in group A and 64
      women in group B. Data on maternal age, gestational age, type of delivery,
      neonatal birth weight and length, and Apgar score showed no significant
      differences. Total length of labor was 363.58+/-62.20 minutes in Group A versus
      292.30+/-64.75 minutes in group B (p<0.001). The length of active labor showed no
      significant difference. Among neonatal parameters we found a statistically
      significant difference only for length of first breastfeeding, with a mean
      duration of <30 minutes in 62.2% in group A versus 29.3% in Group B (p<0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Epidural analgesia has little effect on trend of labor and duration 
      of first breastfeed and none on neonatal outcome. A new protocol of epidural
      analgesia may solve these side effects.

TI  - [Different methods for the induction of labour in postterm pregnancy].
PG  - 796-811
LID - 10.1016/j.jgyn.2011.09.021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Define methods of induction of labour for the population of pregnant 
      women at the end of 41 SA and beyond, including membranes sweeping, mechanical
      and pharmacological procedures as oxytocin, prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol) and E2
      (dinoprostone) and other methods as well for the scarred uterus. METHODS:
      Bibliographic research done by consulting databases PubMed, and Cochrane.
      RESULTS: Membrane sweeping reduces by 41% the need of induction of labour at 41
      SA and 72% for postterm (42 SA). Membrane sweeping is a technique with some
      discomfort for the patient but has advantages. This procedure should not be
      imposed on patients in a systematic visit because it presents inconveniences
      (contractions, bleeding, pain). Oxytocin remains the gold standard used for
      labour induction and requires well-codified rationale protocols in maternity for 
      increasing doses. Most of the trials show that this product is appropriate when
      the cervix is considered as favorable (Bishop >/= 6). In the presence of intact
      membranes, induction by oxytocin must be associated with amniotomy for a
      significant reduction in "induction-delivery" period. The Foley catheter is a
      mechanically reliable, reproducible method for inducing labour with less uterine 
      hyperstimulation without increasing the rate of caesarean sections. It is an
      interesting process but maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity appears to be 
      possibly increased. The non-vaginal PGE2 (cervical) are no longer recommended.
      The PGE2 vaginal gel or pessary are comparable methods to induce labour. They can
      be used to successfully induce labour regardless of cervical Bishop score. In
      case of unfavorable cervical conditions, PGE2 can reduce the use of oxytocin and 
      decrease the required doses. Misoprostol is a molecule that may be proposed for
      induction of labour provided to know the doses, risks and side effects and to
      adapt materno-fetal monitoring. The optimal route of administration remains yet
      to be assessed because of a higher risk of hyperstimulation or tachysystole.
      Initial doses should be 25 mug. However, misoprostol did not have the
      authorization in this indication and merit some caution when using it.
      Prostaglandin E1 is associated with a high risk of uterine rupture and should not
      be used after caesarean section. Acupuncture, homeopathy NO donors, breast
      stimulation or sexual intercourse are methods ineffective in all conditions or
      assessment is insufficient to conclude with evidence based medicine. CONCLUSION: 
      In postterm, different procedures could be performed for induction of labour.
      Furthermore membrane sweeping, oxytocin is the drug of choice for induction on
      favourable cervix and one of the most commonly used drugs. Vaginal prostaglandins
      E2 are effective whatever the cervical conditions. Misoprostol is a very
      interesting pharmacological molecule without authorization in this indication but
      has real advantages on efficacy, cost, storage and administration. Other studies 
      with high power have to remain on track and to focus on the optimal and route
      doses because of increased risk of tachysystole or hyperstimulation with effects 
      on the FHR. Minimal doses at 25mug seem to be safe. The Foley catheter is a
      reliable method without any pharmacological effect and opening interesting
      perspectives but with caution about the possible increased infectious risks.

TI  - Dynamics of milk removal during simultaneous breast expression in women.
PG  - 100-6
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2011.0013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dynamics of milk removal during breast expression. 
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study used a continuous weighing balance to determine 
      changes in milk flow rate and their relationship to the proportion of milk
      removed over time and the percentage of the available milk removed during
      simultaneous expression (15 minutes) of the left and right breasts in 34 mothers 
      of healthy, term, breastfeeding infants. RESULTS: Multiple milk ejections
      (5.1+/-2.0; range, two to 14) were detected as increases in milk flow rate. A
      larger total expression volume was associated with a higher maximum milk flow
      rate (p<0.001). However, 14% less of the available milk was removed for a 100 g
      increase in available milk (p<0.001). After 2.9+/-1.4 and 6.0+/-2.5 minutes, 50% 
      and 80%, respectively, of the total expression volume was removed. Milk flow was 
      more active in the first 7 minutes than the last 7 minutes. At the eighth minute 
      (midpoint), 54+/-25% of the available milk and 86+/-9% of the total expression
      volume were removed. CONCLUSIONS: The maximum milk flow rate was predictive of
      the total volume expressed. After the eighth minute of expression the milk flow
      rate was reduced. Increasing volumes of milk in the breast were associated with
      less complete breast emptying. These data suggest that long expression sessions
      are not required for mothers who are not pump dependent and that extending
      intervals between expressions results in less effective milk removal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the consistency of milk ejections and
      milk expression characteristics within mothers at repeated expression sessions.
      METHODS: Twenty-five breastfeeding mothers expressed their breasts simultaneously
      on three occasions within 3 weeks, and follow-up visits were performed at 6, 9,
      and 12 months of lactation. During the 15-minute expression, milk was collected
      onto a continuous weigh balance to measure milk flow rate. RESULTS: The number of
      milk ejections was similar at the three sessions (5.1+/-2.0), decreasing at the
      12-month follow-up (3.3+/-1.2). Mothers had a similar pattern of milk ejection at
      each session. The time that each milk ejection occurred was consistent for the
      first 9 months of lactation. Of the four milk ejection patterns identified, each 
      removed a similar percentage of available milk but varied in the time to reach
      80% of the total expression volume. The first two milk ejections produced the
      greatest percentage (62%) of total milk volume during breast expression.
      CONCLUSIONS: For each individual mother, the timing, pattern, and number of milk 
      ejections were consistent, suggesting a predetermined release of oxytocin. In
      light of the innate oxytocin release and milk removal characteristics in women,
      there is potential for individual tailoring of the duration of expression.

TI  - Misexpression of wingless-related MMTV integration site 5A in mouse mammary gland
      inhibits the milk ejection response and regulates connexin43 phosphorylation.
PG  - 907-15
LID - 10.1095/biolreprod.111.091645 [doi]
AB  - Wingless-related MMTV integration site 5A (Wnt5a) is a noncanonical signaling WNT
      that is expressed in every stage of mouse mammary gland development except
      lactation. Using slow release pellets containing WNT5A as well as Wnt5a-null
      tissue, we previously showed that WNT5A acts to limit mammary development. Here, 
      we generated transgenic mice that overexpress WNT5A in the mammary epithelium
      using the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (M5a mice). Lactation was impaired
      in two high WNT5A-expressing lines. Lactation defects could not be explained by
      differences in apoptosis, lineage differentiation, milk synthesis, or secretion. 
      Instead, misexpression of WNT5A led to a failure in oxytocin response and milk
      ejection. Noting the similarity between the M5a phenotype and that of mice with a
      mutation in connexin43 (Cx43; official gene symbol Gja1), we examined Cx43
      phosphorylation and localization in M5a mice. In wild-type mice, Cx43 switched
      from a phosphorylated to a more hypophosphorylated form after parturition. In
      contrast, the phosphorylated form of Cx43 was maintained after parturition in M5a
      mice. Using a nontumorigenic breast cell line, MCF10A, we showed that, in
      addition to increasing the levels of phosphorylation of Cx43 on serine-368,
      ectopic expression of WNT5A reduced or blocked the amount of dye transferred
      between cells. In summary, we propose that WNT5A inhibits the response to
      oxytocin and prevents milk ejection through regulation of Cx43 function.

TI  - PI3K/Akt responses to oxytocin stimulation in Caco2BB gut cells.
PG  - 3216-26
LID - 10.1002/jcb.23243 [doi]
AB  - Recently, we discovered oxytocin receptor (OTR) expression in the developing gut 
      villus epithelium that emerges in villus-crypt junctions after weaning. Oxytocin 
      (OT) and OTR regulate many physiological functions in various tissues; however,
      their function in gut epithelium is unknown. We explored responses of PI3K and
      Akt phosphoisoforms to OT stimuli in the Caco2BB human gut cell line. In Caco2BB 
      cells, PI3K and pAkt levels peaked at 62.5 nM OT. At higher concentrations, PI3K 
      decreased more gradually than pAkt(S473) suggesting that the pAkt(S473) response 
      is separate from PI3K. At </=7.8 nM OT, pAkt(T308) increased while pAkt(S473)
      decreased. Using a specific OTR antagonist, we demonstrated that responses of
      pAkt(T308) to OT depend on OTR in contrast to the partial OTR-dependence of the
      pAkt(S473) response. Differential pAkt phosphoisoform responses included pAkt
      phosphoserine 473 persistently free of phosphothreonine 308. The reduction in
      PI3K after 62.5 nM OT for 30 min coincided with OTR internalization. The PI3K/Akt
      activation profile was somewhat different in other cell lines (MCF-7 breast
      cancer cells, HT29 gut cells), which have PI3K activating mutations, that were
      examined to establish experimental parameters. In Caco2BB cells, the divergent
      effects of OT upon pAkt phosphoisoforms suggests separate sub-pathways; pAkt
      (T308) activation depends on OTR via the PI3K pathway and pAkt(S473) presumably
      results from its specific kinase mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex
      2). Thus, OT may modulate gut cell functions downstream of mTOR complexes (e.g., 
      translation control as suggested by others in uterine cells). We will next
      explore OT-stimulated kinase activities downstream of mTOR related to pAkt
      phosphoisoforms.

TI  - Neuroendocrine foundation of maternal-child attachment.
PG  - 21-6
AB  - Attachment between mother and child is the unique and complex type of
      relationship that ensures safety and nurturing of a child in the beginning and
      effective functioning and ability to establish relationships later on. Maternal
      behavior is generally known to be influenced by multiple psychosocial factors.
      However they often fail to explain the deviations in maternal behavior that
      emphasizes the importance and necessity of investigating involved physiological
      mechanisms. Series of the studies performed in animal models demonstrated that
      decline in progesterone level on the background of increasing estradiol
      concentration prepares brain for the action of progesterone and prolactin that
      are responsible for the rapid onset of maternal behavior postpartum. However the 
      results of another group of researchers failed to prove the unique importance of 
      oxytocin. Other substances such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin were
      also suggested though diversity in the study results interferes with making
      definitive conclusions. Preliminary studies suggest that hormones are also
      involved in induction of maternal behavior in primate and human beings. Level of 
      oxytocin appeared to be highest during first hours after parturition and is
      stimulated by a newborn suckling activities and newborn touching the breast.
      Lower rates of anxiety and aggression and higher rates of social behavior was
      demonstrated in mothers having received intrapartum oxytocin infusion. However
      other components of maternal behavior have not been studied in these women.
      Controversial results have been published concerning the importance of cortisol. 
      A group of researchers demonstrated that mothers with higher cortisol levels were
      less caring and more aggressive towards their offspring though according to
      another group of researchers higher level of cortisol is associated with
      increased alertness of mother towards smell and sounds produced by a child. The
      literature review revealed that the number of conducted studies is large though
      limited to animal models, controversial and insufficient to describe the
      biological foundation of maternal behavior in human. Thus great deal of
      investigations should be done to study the biological foundation of maternal
      behavior induction and maintenance, mechanisms of hormonal action and correlation
      between the biological and non-biological, namely psycho-social factors. New
      discoveries in this field will greatly contribute to child global development as 
      it provides clues to the improvement of maternal-child attachment.

TI  - Hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis disruption in rats with breast cancer is
      related to an altered endogenous oxytocin/insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP)
      system.
PG  - 543-9
LID - 10.1007/s13277-010-0149-y [doi]
AB  - Associations of breast cancer with diseases of the thyroid have been repeatedly
      reported, but the mechanism underlying this association remains to be elucidated.
      It has been reported that oxytocin (OXT) attenuates the thyroid-stimulating
      hormone (TSH) release in response to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) and
      decreased plasma levels of TSH as well as the thyroid hormones by an effect
      mediated by the central nervous system. Oxytocinase (IRAP) is the regulatory
      proteolytic enzyme reported to hydrolyze OXT. Changes in IRAP activity have been 
      reported in both human breast cancer and N-methyl-nitrosourea (NMU)-induced rat
      mammary tumours. Here, we measure IRAP activity fluorometrically using
      cystyl-beta-naphthylamide as the substrate, in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid
      axis together with the circulating levels of OXT, and its relationship with
      circulating levels of TSH and free thyroxine (fT4), as markers of thyroid
      function in control rats and rats with breast cancer induced by NMU. We found
      decreased thyroid function in rats with breast cancer induced by NMU, supported
      by the existence of lower serum circulating levels of both TSH and fT4 than their
      corresponding controls. Concomitantly, we found a decrease of hypothalamic IRAP
      activity and an increase in circulating levels of OXT. We propose that breast
      cancer increases OXT pituitary release by decreasing its hypothalamic catabolism 
      through IRAP activity, probably due to the alteration of the estrogenic endocrine
      status. Thus, high circulating levels of OXT decreased TSH release from the
      pituitary, and therefore, of thyroid hormones from the thyroid, supporting the
      association between breast cancer and thyroid function disruption.

TI  - Labour analgesia and the baby: good news is no news.
PG  - 38-50
LID - 10.1016/j.ijoa.2010.08.004 [doi]
AB  - When investigating different methods of maternal pain relief in labour, neonatal 
      outcome has not always been at the forefront, or else maternal changes, such as
      haemodynamics, fever, length of labour, need for oxytocin or type of delivery,
      are taken as surrogates for neonatal outcome. It is essential to examine the
      actual baby and to appreciate that labour pain itself has adverse consequences
      for the baby. For systemic analgesia, pethidine has been most extensively studied
      and compared with neuraxial analgesia. It depresses fetal muscular activity,
      aortic blood flow, short-term heart rate variability and oxygen saturation. In
      the newborn it exacerbates acidosis, depresses Apgar scores, respiration,
      neurobehavioural score, muscle tone and suckling. Alternatives have few
      advantages, remifentanil being the most promising. Neuraxial analgesia is
      associated with better Apgar scores and variable neurobehavioural changes.
      Neonatal acid-base status is not only better with epidural than with systemic
      opioid analgesia, it is also better than with no analgesia. The effect on breast 
      feeding has yet to be established, though it is certainly no worse than that of
      systemic opioid analgesia. Variations in neuraxial technique have little impact
      on the newborn. Widespread ignorance of the benefit to the newborn of neuraxial
      labour analgesia in the UK among non-anaesthetists needs to be combated.

TI  - Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation.
PG  - CD006946
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD006946.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast engorgement is a painful and unpleasant condition affecting
      large numbers of women in the early postpartum period. During a time when mothers
      are coping with the demands of a new baby it may be particularly distressing.
      Breast engorgement may inhibit the development of successful breastfeeding, lead 
      to early breastfeeding cessation, and is associated with more serious illness,
      including breast infection. OBJECTIVES: To identify the best forms of treatment
      for women who experience breast engorgement. SEARCH STRATEGY: We identified
      studies for inclusion through the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's
      Trials Register (February 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and
      quasi-randomised controlled trials where treatments for breast engorgement were
      evaluated. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed eligibility 
      for inclusion and carried out data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight
      studies with 744 women. Trials examined a range of different treatments for
      breast engorgement: acupuncture (two studies), cabbage leaves (two studies), cold
      gel packs (one study), pharmacological treatments (two studies) and ultrasound
      (one study). For several interventions (ultrasound, cabbage leaves, and oxytocin)
      there was no statistically significant evidence that interventions were
      associated with a more rapid resolution of symptoms; in these studies women
      tended to have improvements in pain and other symptoms over time whether or not
      they received active treatment. There was evidence from one study that, compared 
      with women receiving routine care, women receiving acupuncture had greater
      improvements in symptoms in the days following treatment, although there was no
      evidence of a difference between groups by six days, and the study did not have
      sufficient power to detect meaningful differences for other outcomes (such as
      breast abscess). A study examining protease complex reported findings favouring
      intervention groups although it is more than 40 years since the study was carried
      out, and we are not aware that this preparation is used in current practice. A
      study looking at cold packs suggested that the application of cold does not cause
      harm, and may be associated with improvements in symptoms, although differences
      between control and intervention groups at baseline mean that results are
      difficult to interpret. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Allthough some interventions may be
      promising, there is not sufficient evidence from trials on any intervention to
      justify widespread implementation. More research is needed on treatments for this
      painful and distressing condition.

TI  - Alternative versus conventional institutional settings for birth.
PG  - CD000012
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD000012.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alternative institutional settings have been established for the care
      of pregnant women who prefer and require little or no medical intervention. The
      settings may offer care throughout pregnancy and birth, or only during labour;
      they may be part of hospitals or freestanding entities. Specially designed labour
      rooms include bedroom-like rooms, ambient rooms, and Snoezelen rooms. OBJECTIVES:
      Primary: to assess the effects of care in an alternative institutional birth
      environment compared to care in a conventional institutional setting. Secondary: 
      to determine if the effects of birth settings are influenced by staffing,
      architectural features, organizational models or geographical location. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials
      Register (31 May 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized or quasi-randomized
      controlled trials which compared the effects of an alternative institutional
      maternity care setting to conventional hospital care. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: We used standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration Pregnancy and
      Childbirth Group. Two review authors evaluated methodological quality. We
      performed double data entry and have presented results using risk ratios (RR) and
      95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials involving 10684 women
      met the inclusion criteria. We found no trials of freestanding birth centres or
      Snoezelen rooms. Allocation to an alternative setting increased the likelihood
      of: no intrapartum analgesia/anaesthesia (five trials, n = 7842; RR 1.17, 95% CI 
      1.01 to 1.35); spontaneous vaginal birth (eight trials; n = 10,218; RR 1.04, 95% 
      CI 1.02 to 1.06); breastfeeding at six to eight weeks (one trial, n = 1147; RR
      1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.06); and very positive views of care (two trials, n =
      1207; RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.15). Allocation to an alternative setting
      decreased the likelihood of epidural analgesia (seven trials, n = 9820; RR 0.82, 
      95% CI 0.75 to 0.89); oxytocin augmentation of labour (seven trials, n = 10,020; 
      RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.91); and episiotomy (seven trials, n = 9944; RR 0.83,
      95% CI 0.77 to 0.90). There was no apparent effect on serious perinatal or
      maternal morbidity/mortality, other adverse neonatal outcomes, or postpartum
      hemorrhage. No firm conclusions could be drawn regarding the effects of
      variations in staffing, organizational models, or architectural characteristics
      of the alternative settings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: When compared to conventional 
      settings, hospital-based alternative birth settings are associated with increased
      likelihood of spontaneous vaginal birth, reduced medical interventions and
      increased maternal satisfaction.

TI  - Safety and efficacy of galactogogues: substances that induce, maintain and
      increase breast milk production.
PG  - 162-74
AB  - Poor production of breast milk is the most frequent cause of breast lactation
      failure. Often, physician prescribe medications or other substances to solve this
      problem. The use of galactogogues should be limited to those situations in which 
      reduced milk production from treatable causes has been excluded. One of the most 
      frequent indication for the use of galactogogues is the diminution of milk
      production in mothers using indirect lactation, particularly in the case of
      preterm birth. The objective of this review is to analyze to the literature
      relating to the principal drugs used as galactogogues (metoclopramide,
      domperidone, chlorpromazine, sulpiride, oxytocin, growth hormone, thyrotrophin
      releasing hormone, medroxyprogesterone). Have been also analyzed galactogogues
      based on herbs and other natural substances (fenugreek, galega and milk thistle).
      We have evaluated their mechanism of action, transfer to maternal milk,
      effectiveness and potential side effects for mother and infant, suggested doses
      for galactogogic effect, and recommendation for breastfeeding.

TI  - Effect of Sauropus androgynus leaf extracts on the expression of prolactin and
      oxytocin genes in lactating BALB/C mice.
PG  - 31-6
LID - 10.1159/000319710 [doi]
AB  - Sauropus androgynus is traditionally consumed by Indonesians and is believed to
      increase breast milk production during lactation. Lactation, a process of milk
      synthesis and secretion, occurs with the help of 2 hormones, prolactin and
      oxytocin. The expressions of genes encoding prolactin and oxytocin were analyzed 
      in lactating BALB/C mice brains using qRT-PCR. A total of 24 lactating BALB/C
      mice were fed with experimental diets for 12 days. Two groups of lactating mice
      were fed with diets containing either young or mature S. androgynus leaf
      extracts. For the control, one group of lactating mice was fed a diet without S. 
      androgynus leaf extracts. Supplementation of young S. androgynus leaf extracts
      increased the expression of prolactin and oxytocin genes in lactating mice 9.04- 
      and 2.25-fold, respectively. Meanwhile, supplementation of mature S. androgynus
      leaf extracts increased the expressions of both genes 15.75- and 25.77-fold,
      respectively, compared to the control group. The result suggested that mature S. 
      androgynus leaf extracts significantly increased the expressions of both genes in
      lactating BALB/C mice and was predicted to correlate with papaverine content,
      which is only detected in mature S. androgynus leaves at a concentration of 0.38 
      +/- 0.04 mug.ml(-1).

TI  - Oxytocin release in magnocellular nuclei: neurochemical mediators and functional 
      significance during gestation.
PG  - R452-8
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00217.2010 [doi]
AB  - When released from dendrites within the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular
      (PVN) nuclei (intranuclear release) during suckling, oxytocin exerts autocrine
      and paracrine effects on oxytocin neurons that are necessary for the unique
      timing and episodic pattern of oxytocin release into the systemic circulation
      that is characteristic of lactation. Recent reports have shown that stimulation
      of central noradrenergic and histaminergic receptors are both necessary for
      intranuclear release of oxytocin in response to suckling. In addition, in vitro
      studies indicate that excitatory amino acids may also be critical for central
      oxytocin secretion, although in vivo experiments have not provided direct support
      for this hypothesis. In addition to a critical role in intranuclear oxytocin
      release during lactation, norepinephrine has also been shown to stimulate central
      oxytocin during gestation. Stimulation of central oxytocin receptors during
      gestation appears critical for normal systemic oxytocin secretion in responses to
      suckling during the subsequent period of lactation. Oxytocin receptor blockade
      during pregnancy alters normal timing of systemic oxytocin release during
      suckling and reduces milk delivery. Several adaptations occur in the central
      oxytocin system that are necessary for determining the unique response
      characteristic observed during parturition and gestation. Central oxytocin
      receptor stimulation during gestation has been implicated in pregnancy-related
      morphological changes in magnocellular oxytocin neurons, disinhibition of
      oxytocin neurons to GABA, and adaptations in membrane response characteristics of
      oxytocin neurons. In conclusion, intranuclear oxytocin release during gestation
      and lactation are critical for establishing, and then evoking the unique pattern 
      of systemic oxytocin secretion in response to the suckling offspring necessary
      for adequate milk delivery. Furthermore, activation of central noradrenergic
      receptors appears to be critical for release of central oxytocin in both of these
      reproductive states.

TI  - 'Too scary to think about': first time mothers' perceptions of the usefulness of 
      antenatal breastfeeding education.
PG  - 160-5
LID - 10.1016/j.wombi.2010.04.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this pilot study was to uncover the perceived
      usefulness of a contemporary antenatal education strategy for mother's experience
      of breastfeeding initiation. RESEARCH QUESTION: How useful do first time mothers 
      perceive an antenatal education strategy to be for initiating breastfeeding?
      PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This was a simple descriptive pilot study with ten
      first time mothers as participants; all of whom were booked into an Australian
      private maternity unit for antenatal breastfeeding education, labour, birth and
      postpartum care. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed verbatim and
      thematically analysed. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION: Antenatal education was
      beneficial for informing first time mothers of the practical skills required to
      positively initiate breastfeeding. However, this antenatal education strategy was
      not enough to reduce anxiety and foster the participants sense of self-confidence
      in their ability to breastfeed their newborns. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:
      Recommendations are made to focus antenatal breastfeeding strategies on first, a 
      strength based model that builds confidence in women's ability to successfully
      breastfeed. Second, in the interests of fully informed consent, women are to be
      advised about the physiological connection between pregnancy, labour, birth and
      breastfeeding and the impact that interventions such as synthetic oxytocin,
      caesarean section and epidural anaesthesia are likely to have on the initiation
      of breastfeeding.

      breast cancer.
PG  - 321-5
LID - 10.1007/s10689-010-9344-7 [doi]
AB  - The high rate of interval malignancies urges for new screening methods for women 
      at high risk for breast cancer. Nipple aspiration provides direct access to the
      breast tissue and its DNA, and therefore is a likely candidate, but clinical
      applications have been limited by the failure to obtain nipple aspiration fluid
      from most women. We performed oxytocin-assisted nipple aspiration in 90 women at 
      increased risk for breast cancer based on family history or genetic test results 
      (n = 63) and/or previous breast cancer (n = 34). Nipple fluid was obtained from
      81/90 women (90%) and bilaterally in 77%. Mean discomfort rating was 0.6 (on a
      0-10 scale), which was significantly lower than for mammography or MRI. These
      findings suggest that a new tool for biomarker detection in oxytocin-assisted
      nipple fluid of women at high risk for breast cancer is at hand.

TI  - Measuring milk synthesis in breastfeeding mothers.
PG  - 103-7
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2009.0074 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Breastfeeding mothers expressed their breasts hourly for periods up to 7
      hours, without exogenous oxytocin, to determine the consistency of milk removal
      and the relationship between the volume of milk removed and the mother's 24-hour 
      milk production. METHODS: Mothers (n = 20) measured their 24-hour milk production
      from each breast by test-weighing their babies at home. Mothers came to the
      research laboratory for a day visit and expressed milk from either both or one
      breast (left or right) for 10-15 minutes, every hour for 2-7 hours. Mothers were 
      not instructed to restrict breastfeeding prior to the first (0-hour) expression. 
      RESULTS: It was found that the milk volume at 1 hour (59.7 +/- 36.5 and 46.5 +/- 
      25.6 mL/hour for the right and left breast, respectively) was significantly (p < 
      0.05) higher than the milk volume from subsequent hourly intervals. The average
      hourly volumes obtained from the 2nd to 7th hour (18.0 +/- 3.1 and 14.0 +/- 4.8
      mL/hour for the right and left breast, respectively) were not significantly
      different from the average hourly rates calculated for the 24-hour milk
      production (18.4 +/- 6.3 and 15.5 +/- 5.1 mL/hour for the right and left breast, 
      respectively). Furthermore, local inhibition was not observed during hourly
      expressions of up to 7 hours. CONCLUSION: The average hourly volumes of milk from
      the 2nd to 7th hour expressions could provide an estimate of the rate of milk
      secretion. Further study is required to fully validate these findings.

PG  - 1292-7

AB  - UNLABELLED: Different breastfeeding methods (traditional scheduled, demand or
      baby-led) influence lactation physiology by either supporting or interfering with
      the let-down reflex, by an autocrine effect in the breast, and indirectly via
      infant appetite. Postnatal breast morphological changes and neonatal
      osmoregulation are also susceptible to breastfeeding method. Feed length is
      important: short feeds from both breasts (employed in traditional methods)
      optimize breast morphological changes and neonatal osmoregulation, condition the 
      let-down reflex, limit autocrine inhibition, stimulate the infant's appetite and 
      are associated with a plentiful supply of milk. However, the limited evidence
      available on prolonged feeds and those from only one breast (both often seen with
      the baby-led method), suggests interference with lactation because of a
      compromised let-down reflex and autocrine inhibition, resulting in a reduced milk
      supply. CONCLUSION: Regular short feeds from both breasts encourage a plentiful
      milk supply and successful breastfeeding: these are best reflected by a modified 
      traditional breastfeeding method.

TI  - The myoepithelial cell: its role in normal mammary glands and breast cancer.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Mammary gland epithelium is composed of an inner layer of secretory cells
      (luminal) and an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MEC) bordering the basal
      lamina which separates the epithelial layer from the extracellular matrix. Mature
      MECs morphologically resemble smooth muscle cells; however, they exhibit features
      typical for epithelial cells, such as the presence of specific cytokeratin
      filaments. During lactation, secretory cells synthesize milk components, which
      are collected in alveoli and duct lumen, and transported to the nipple as a
      result of MEC contraction. Although the induction of MEC contraction results from
      oxytocin action, also other, still unknown auto/paracrine mechanisms participate 
      in the regulation of this process. As well as milk ejection, MECs are involved in
      mammary gland morphogenesis in all developmental stages, modulating proliferation
      and differentiation of luminal cells. They take part in the formation of
      extracellular matrix, synthesizing its components and secreting proteinases and
      their inhibitors. In addition, MECs are regarded as natural cancer suppressors,
      stabilizing the normal structure of the mammary gland, they secrete suppressor
      proteins (e.g. maspin) limiting cancer growth, invasiveness, and neoangiogenesis.
      The majority of malignant breast cancers are derived from luminal cells, whereas 
      neoplasms of MEC origin are the most seldom and usually benign form of breast
      tumours. MECs are markedly resistant to malignant transformation and they are
      able to suppress the transformation of neighboring luminal cells. Therefore, a
      deeper insight into the role of MECs in the physiology and pathology of mammary
      glands would allow a better understanding of cancerogenesis mechanisms and
      possible application of specific MEC markers in the diagnosis and therapy of
      breast cancer.

AB  - Oxytocin (OT) is a peptide increasingly studied in relation to human social
      interactions, affiliation, and clinical disorders. Studies are constrained by use
      of invasive blood draws and would benefit from a reliable salivary OT assay. Our 
      goals were to examine feasibility of salivary OT measurement, compare salivary to
      plasma OT responses in 12 breast- and 8 formula-feeding mothers, and assess the
      degree of correlation between plasma and salivary OT. Using a commercial EIA kit,
      we measured OT in 5 saliva and 7 plasma samples in a protocol designed to elicit 
      changes in OT (Rest, Infant Interaction, Stress, Feeding). Breast-feeders had
      higher OT levels than formula-feeders across all conditions in plasma (+36%) and 
      saliva (+23%). OT levels and ranges were similar in saliva and plasma, with
      slightly greater variance in saliva. Concurrently sampled plasma and salivary OT 
      were correlated at end of Baseline Rest (r=+.59, p=.022) and Post-Stress Recovery
      (r=+.59, p=.025). These data suggest that salivary OT assay is feasible, and will
      be of value where plasma samples are not possible. Validation with larger samples
      is needed.

TI  - Molecular distinctions between stasis and telomere attrition senescence barriers 
      shown by long-term culture of normal human mammary epithelial cells.
PG  - 7557-68
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0270 [doi]
AB  - Normal human epithelial cells in culture have generally shown a limited
      proliferative potential of approximately 10 to 40 population doublings before
      encountering a stress-associated senescence barrier (stasis) associated with
      elevated levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16 and/or p21. We now show
      that simple changes in medium composition can expand the proliferative potential 
      of human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) initiated as primary cultures to 50 to
      60 population doublings followed by p16-positive, senescence-associated
      beta-galactosidase-positive stasis. We compared the properties of growing and
      senescent pre-stasis HMEC with growing and senescent post-selection HMEC, that
      is, cells grown in a serum-free medium that overcame stasis via silencing of p16 
      expression and that display senescence associated with telomere dysfunction.
      Cultured pre-stasis populations contained cells expressing markers associated
      with luminal and myoepithelial HMEC lineages in vivo in contrast to the
      basal-like phenotype of the post-selection HMEC. Gene transcript and protein
      expression, DNA damage-associated markers, mean telomere restriction fragment
      length, and genomic stability differed significantly between HMEC populations at 
      the stasis versus telomere dysfunction senescence barriers. Senescent isogenic
      fibroblasts showed greater similarity to HMEC at stasis than at telomere
      dysfunction, although their gene transcript profile was distinct from HMEC at
      both senescence barriers. These studies support our model of the senescence
      barriers encountered by cultured HMEC in which the first barrier, stasis, is
      retinoblastoma-mediated and independent of telomere length, whereas a second
      barrier (agonescence or crisis) results from telomere attrition leading to
      telomere dysfunction. Additionally, the ability to maintain long-term growth of
      genomically stable multilineage pre-stasis HMEC populations can greatly enhance
      experimentation with normal HMEC.

TI  - Associations of drugs routinely given in labour with breastfeeding at 48 hours:
      analysis of the Cardiff Births Survey.
PG  - 1622-9; discussion 1630-2
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2009.02256.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about how breastfeeding rates are affected by drugs
      routinely administered in labour. OBJECTIVE: To examine a large obstetric data
      set to investigate potentially modifiable associations between drugs routinely
      administered in labour and breastfeeding in healthy women and infants. DESIGN:
      Retrospective cohort. SETTING: The Cardiff (Wales UK) Births Survey. POPULATION: 
      A total of 48 366 healthy women delivering healthy singleton babies at term.
      METHODS: Analysis of the Cardiff Births Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Association
      between intrapartum medications and breastfeeding at 48 hours postpartum.
      RESULTS: At 48 hours, 43.3% (20 933/48 366) women were not breastfeeding.
      Regression analysis confirmed previously reported associations of lower
      breastfeeding rates with certain demographic indicators, epidural analgesia,
      intramuscular opioid analgesia and ergometrine. Novel associations were detected 
      with oxytocin alone or in combination with ergometrine administered for
      prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), which were associated with reductions
      of 6-8%, (intramuscular oxytocin OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.91, intravenous oxytocin 
      OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.82, oxytocin/ergometrine OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65-0.91), and
      prostaglandins administered for induction of labour. The associations were
      maintained when subgroups, such as primiparous women, women whose labours were
      neither induced nor augmented, and women not receiving epidural analgesia were
      considered. CONCLUSION: Prospective studies on drugs in labour are needed to
      investigate potential causative associations between intrapartum medications and 
      breastfeeding. Such studies will delineate the optimum balance between
      breastfeeding and maternal health, most importantly the risk of PPH.

TI  - Effects of sucking and skin-to-skin contact on maternal ACTH and cortisol levels 
      during the second day postpartum-influence of epidural analgesia and oxytocin in 
      the perinatal period.
PG  - 207-20
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2009.0001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In this study we made a detailed analysis of the mothers'
      release pattern of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol during a
      breastfeeding session during the second day postpartum and related these patterns
      to maternal oxytocin levels as well to the duration of sucking and the duration
      of skin-to-skin contact before sucking the breast. Furthermore, we investigated
      if epidural analgesia and oxytocin administration during and after labor
      influenced the release pattern of ACTH and cortisol. METHODS: Sixty-three
      primiparae were included in the study. Fourteen received oxytocin intramuscularly
      postpartum, nine received oxytocin infusion, 14 received epidural analgesia
      combined with oxytocin infusion, and six received epidural analgesia alone.
      Twenty mothers did not receive any of these medical interventions. Blood samples 
      were analyzed for ACTH and cortisol by enzyme-linked immunoassay. RESULTS: Both
      ACTH and cortisol levels fell significantly during the breastfeeding session. A
      significant negative relationship was found between oxytocin and ACTH levels, but
      not between oxytocin and cortisol levels. A positive and significant relationship
      was found between ACTH and cortisol levels. The duration of skin-to-skin contact 
      before onset of sucking was significantly and negatively associated with lower
      cortisol levels, but not with ACTH levels. Cortisol levels differed significantly
      between mothers having received epidural analgesia with and without oxytocin.
      CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding is associated with a decrease of ACTH and cortisol
      levels. Skin-to-skin contact contributes to this effect. ACTH correlated
      negatively with the duration of sucking and with median oxytocin levels, whereas 
      cortisol levels correlated inversely with the duration of skin-to-skin contact
      preceding sucking, suggesting a partial dissociation between the mechanisms
      regulating ACTH and cortisol release. In addition, medical interventions in
      connection with birth influence the activity of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 2 days after birth.

TI  - [Nongenomic mechanisms of progesterone].
PG  - 403-16
AB  - Rapid, independent of transcriptional effects of progesterone have been observed 
      in various types of cells, tissues and species. In some biological systems, these
      nongenomic actions and associated with them signal transduction pathways are
      characterized in detail at molecular level. This review summarizes findings
      concerning the role of progestins in the regulation of such physiological
      functions and processes as meiotic maturation of fish and amphibian oocytes;
      growth and proliferation of normal and transformed cells of mammary gland;
      contraction of myometrium; survival and functional activity of granulose cells;
      sperm capacitation, acrosome reaction and hypermotility; immune function of T
      lymphocytes; survival and function of brain cells. The participation of several
      types of receptor proteins in the nongenomic progesterone signaling is discussed.
      They include the classic nuclear progesterone receptor, PR, the membrane
      progestin receptor, mPR, the progesterone membrane receptor component, PGMRC, the
      oxytocin receptor, OTR, and the GABA receptor, GABA(A).

TI  - Detection of salivary oxytocin levels in lactating women.
PG  - 367-73
LID - 10.1002/dev.20376 [doi]
AB  - Oxytocin is a neuropeptide with widespread influence on many physiological and
      social functions including: labor and birth, lactation, sexual behavior,
      nurturing maternal behaviors, and stress reduction. However, our understanding of
      oxytocin's roles has been hampered by lack of noninvasive methods for assessing
      oxytocin levels. The goal of the present study was to assess whether oxytocin
      could be detected in saliva and whether changes occurred in the pattern of
      oxytocin release among lactating women from before, at initiation and after
      breast feeding. Using a prospective repeated measures design, 11 research
      participants each provided 18 saliva samples during three feeding cycles (before,
      at initiation and after breast feeding) for two 24-hr data collection periods
      (Days 1 and 2). Within each day, saliva was collected at late evening, early
      morning, and late morning. Salivary samples were concentrated fourfold by
      dehydration prior to analysis and oxytocin was measured in saliva using an enzyme
      immunoassay (EIA). Salivary oxytocin values, when reconverted to their original
      levels, ranged from 6.44 to 61.05 pg/ml. Oxytocin values in saliva varied
      significantly as a function of the breast feeding cycle, but did not show
      reliable differences as a function of the time of feeding. Oxytocin was highest
      before feeding, followed by a decrease at initiation of feeding, and an increase 
      at 30 min after feeding. The findings suggest that oxytocin release into saliva
      increases in anticipation of feedings. This study also supports the potential
      usefulness of salivary measures of oxytocin as a noninvasive index of changes in 
      this peptide.

TI  - Oxytocin augmentation in grandmultiparous parturients: to give or not to give?
PG  - 781-3
LID - 10.1007/s00404-009-1023-2 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present editorial was aimed to determine policies toward the use
      of oxytocin for labor augmentation among grandmultiparous (above 5 deliveries)
      parturients (GMPs). STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire regarding attitudes toward
      oxytocin augmentation during labor among GMPs was distributed to all chairpersons
      of Ob/Gyn departments throughout the country; 20/23 chairpersons responded to the
      national survey. RESULTS: In all, 85% (17/20) of the chairpersons allowed the use
      of oxytocin for augmentation of labor in GMPs. Those answering positively to this
      question did not choose to limit the use of oxytocin for any level of parity.
      Moreover, 58% (11/19) of them did not obligate the concurrent use of intrauterine
      pressure catheter while using oxytocin augmentation in these patients. Only 22%
      (4/18) of the medical centers surveyed limited the maximal dose of Oxytocin among
      GMPs. The limited dose of oxytocin ranged from 8 to 16 micro/min. Alternatives
      for oxytocin augmentation in GMPs were breast stimulation (30%), and surgical
      induction (15%). Nevertheless, 50% of the chairpersons found no other suitable
      alternative for labor augmentation among GMPs. CONCLUSION: Oxytocin seems like an
      accepted method for labor augmentation among grandmultiparous women. Moreover,
      the vast majority of chairpersons did not mandate additional safety measures such
      as internal uterine catheter or limited dose regimens in these patients.

LID - 10.1177/1099800409331394 [doi]
AB  - The present study was designed to compare milk production and hormone responses
      (prolactin [PRL], oxytocin [OT]) and to determine associations of hormone levels 
      with milk production in mothers of preterm (PT) and term (TM) infants during the 
      first 6 weeks postpartum. Mothers of PT infants (n = 95) were all pump dependent;
      mothers of TM infants (n = 98) were all feeding their infant at breast. Mothers
      of nonnursing PT infants produced less milk over time compared to mothers of TM
      infants. A higher proportion of PT mothers had lower basal PRL levels compared
      with TM mothers. PRL and frequency of breast stimulation combined positively
      influenced milk production in PT mothers. OT levels were higher in PT versus TM
      mothers, but OT was not related to milk production. Further study is warranted
      regarding interventions to enhance milk production, particularly in
      pump-dependent mothers of PT infants.

TI  - Effects of intrapartum oxytocin administration and epidural analgesia on the
      concentration of plasma oxytocin and prolactin, in response to suckling during
      the second day postpartum.
PG  - 71-82
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2008.0002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxytocin and prolactin stimulate milk ejection and milk production
      during breastfeeding. The aim of the present study was to make a detailed
      analysis of maternal release of oxytocin and prolactin in response to
      breastfeeding during the second day postpartum in mothers who had received
      oxytocin either intravenously for stimulation of labor or intramuscularly for
      prevention of postpartum hemorrhage and/or epidural analgesia or those who had
      received no such treatment in connection with birth. METHODS: In a descriptive
      comparative study plasma oxytocin and prolactin concentrations were measured in
      response to suckling during the second day postpartum in women who had received
      intravenous intrapartum oxytocin (n = 8), intramuscular postpartum oxytocin (n = 
      13), or epidural analgesia, either with (n = 14) or without (n = 6) intrapartum
      oxytocin infusion, and women who received none of these interventions (n = 20).
      Hormone levels were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: All mothers showed a
      pulsatile oxytocin pattern during the first 10 minutes of breastfeeding. Women
      who had received epidural analgesia with oxytocin infusion had the lowest
      endogenous median oxytocin levels. The more oxytocin infusion the mothers had
      received during labor, the lower their endogenous oxytocin levels were during a
      breastfeeding during the second day postpartum. A significant rise of prolactin
      was observed after 20 minutes in all women, but after 10 minutes in mothers
      having received oxytocin infusion during labor. In all women, oxytocin
      variability and the rise of prolactin levels between 0 and 20 minutes correlated 
      significantly with median oxytocin and prolactin levels. CONCLUSION: Oxytocin,
      released in a pulsatile way, and prolactin were released by breastfeeding during 
      the second day postpartum. Oxytocin infusion decreased endogenous oxytocin levels
      dose-dependently. Furthermore, oxytocin infusion facilitated the release of
      prolactin. Epidural analgesia in combination with oxytocin infusion influenced
      endogenous oxytocin levels negatively.

TI  - Childbirth practices in rural Rajasthan, India: implications for neonatal health 
      and survival.
PG  - S23-30
LID - 10.1038/jp.2008.174 [doi]
AB  - In a rural community of Rajasthan in north India, we explored family, community
      and provider practices during labor and childbirth, which are likely to influence
      newborn health outcomes. A range of qualitative data-gathering methods was
      applied in two rural clusters of Udaipur district. This paper reports on the key 
      findings from eight direct observations of labor and childbirth at home and in
      primary health facilities, as well as 10 focus group discussions, 18 case
      interviews with recently delivered women and 39 key informant interviews carried 
      out within the community. Although most families preferred home delivery,
      health-facility deliveries were preferred for first births, especially among
      adolescents. A team of birth attendants led by a traditional birth attendant or
      an elder female relative took decisions and performed key functions during home
      childbirth. Modern providers were commonly invited to administer intramuscular
      oxytocin injections to hasten home delivery, whereas health staff tended to do
      the same during facility deliveries. The practice of applying forceful fundal
      pressure, stemming from overriding concern about the woman's inability to deliver
      spontaneously, was near universal in both situations. In both facilities and
      homes, monitoring of labor was largely restricted to repeated unhygienic vaginal 
      examinations with little or no monitoring of fetal or maternal well-being. Babies
      born at home remained lying on the wet floor till the placenta was delivered. The
      cord was usually tied using available twine or ceremonial thread and cut using a 
      new blade. In facility settings, drying and wrapping of the baby after birth was 
      delayed and preparedness for resuscitation was minimal. Families believed in
      delaying breast-feeding till 3 days after birth, when they believed breast milk
      became available. Even hospital staff discharged the mother and newborn without
      efforts to initiate breast-feeding. A combination of traditional and modern
      practices, rooted in the concept of inducing heat to facilitate labor, occurred
      in both home and facility delivery settings. Programs to improve neonatal
      survival in such rural settings will need to invest both in strengthening primary
      health services provided during labor and delivery through training and
      monitoring, and in community promotion of improved newborn care practices.

TI  - Non-genomic progesterone actions in female reproduction.
PG  - 119-38
LID - 10.1093/humupd/dmn044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The steroid hormone progesterone is indispensable for mammalian
      procreation by controlling key female reproductive events that range from
      ovulation to implantation, maintenance of pregnancy and breast development. In
      addition to activating the progesterone receptors (PRs)-B and -A, members of the 
      superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors, progesterone also elicits 
      a variety of rapid signalling events independently of transcriptional or genomic 
      regulation. This review covers our current knowledge on the mechanisms and
      relevance of non-genomic progesterone signalling in female reproduction. METHODS:
      PubMed was searched up to August 2008 for papers on progesterone actions in
      ovary/breast/endometrium/myometrium/brain, focusing primarily on non-genomic
      signalling mechanisms. RESULTS: Convergence and intertwining of rapid non-genomic
      events and the slower transcriptional actions critically determine the functional
      response to progesterone in the female reproductive system in a cell-type- and
      environment-specific manner. Several putative progesterone-binding moieties have 
      been implicated in rapid signalling events, including the 'classical' PR and its 
      variants, progesterone receptor membrane component 1, and the novel family of
      membrane progestin receptors. Progesterone and its metabolites have also been
      implicated in the allosteric regulation of several unrelated receptors, such as
      gamma-aminobutyric acid type A, oxytocin and sigma(1) receptors. CONCLUSIONS:
      Identification of the mechanisms and receptors that relay rapid progesterone
      signalling is an area of research fraught with difficulties and controversy. More
      in-depth characterization of the putative receptors is required before the
      non-genomic progesterone pathway in normal and pathological reproductive function
      can be targeted for pharmacological intervention.

TI  - Intraumbilical veinous injection oxytocin in the active management of third stage
      of labour.
PG  - 551-4
LID - 09.2008/JCPSP.551554 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of intraumbilical vein oxytocin reducing blood
      loss during and after one hour of delivery of placenta and its efficacy in
      reducing the frequency of retained placenta. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled 
      trial. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Combined Military Hospital, Multan, from June
      2002 to October 2002. METHODOLOGY: Five hundred parturient women with low risk
      singleton term pregnancy were enrolled in the study. Two hundred and fifty women 
      each were included in the study and control group after randomization. The
      patients and health care providers both were blinded to the intervention. Primary
      outcome measures were kept as duration and amount of blood loss in third stage of
      labour. Secondary outcome measures included incidence of retained placenta,
      abdominal need for additional utero-tonics, frequency of postpartum pain, nausea 
      and vomiting, fever, need for blood transfusion, establishment of breast feeding 
      and total duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Women in study group who received
      intraumbilical vein syntocinon lost 234.03 ml of blood while the control group
      lost 276.51 ml (p=0.001). Mean duration of third stage was 2.59 minutes in the
      study group and 7.67 minutes in the control group (p<0.001). The frequency of
      retained placenta was 1.2%, which involved only the control group. Abdominal pain
      was experienced by study group but the difference was not found statistically
      significant. Nausea and vomiting was more in study group (p=0.001). No
      discernible difference was found in length of hospital stay, the need for blood
      transfusion, fever and establishment of breast-feeding in both groups.
      CONCLUSION: The addition of intraumbilical vein syntocinon 10 units resulted in
      marked reduction in amount of blood loss, duration of third stage and incidence
      of retained placenta in comparison to intravenous 5 IU oxytocin+0.5 mg
      ergometrine alone.

TI  - Influence of oxytocin or epidural analgesia on personality profile in
      breastfeeding women: a comparative study.
PG  - 335-45
LID - 10.1007/s00737-008-0027-4 [doi]
AB  - Women undergo physiological and psychological changes during pregnancy, labor and
      lactation. The psychological adaptations can be affective, cognitive and
      behavioral and can be measured by dimensional personality instruments. This study
      aims to compare (1) the personality profile in mothers after birth with a
      normative group of non-lactating women and to examine (2) whether the personality
      profile differs 2 days, 2 months and 6 months after birth between mothers who
      have been exposed to epidural anesthesia, oxytocin administration or neither.
      Sixty-nine primiparae were assigned to four groups: mothers having received
      oxytocin infusion during labor (OT iv group, n = 9), mothers having received
      epidural analgesia with/without oxytocin infusion (EDA group, n = 23), mothers
      having received 10 iU oxytocin intramuscularly after birth (OT im group, n = 15) 
      and mothers having received none of these treatments (unmedicated group, n = 22).
      At 2 days and 2 and 6 months postpartum mothers completed the Karolinska Scales
      of Personality (KSP). The unmedicated, the OT iv- and OT im groups scored
      significantly lower on anxiety and aggression related scales and higher on the
      socialization subscale during the entire observation period when compared with a 
      normative group. These differences were not observed in the EDA group 2 days
      postpartum. At 2 and 6 months postpartum, the scores of the EDA group had changed
      significantly and were almost similar to the KSP scores of the other groups.
      ANCOVA analysis revealed that OT infusion, over and above the effects of EDA, was
      associated with decreased levels of several anxiety and aggression subscales. We 
      conclude that women who received exogenous oxytocin during labor show similar
      positive personality traits during breastfeeding such as reduction in anxiety and
      aggression and increasing socialization, including maternal behavior, that have
      previously been ascribed to endogenous oxytocin. More importantly, these effects 
      were not seen at 2 days postpartum in women who received epidural anesthesia
      during labor.

TI  - Molecular analysis of nipple fluid for breast cancer screening.
PG  - 149-52
LID - 10.1159/000123853 [doi]
AB  - Lack of sensitivity and specificity of image-based breast cancer screening has
      urged the exploration of alternate screening modalities. Nipple fluid, which
      contains breast epithelial cells, is produced in small amounts in the breast
      ducts of nonlactating women and can be collected by noninvasive vacuum
      aspiration. After administration of nasal oxytocin, nipple aspiration yields
      sufficient material for molecular analysis in the large majority of women.
      Whereas nipple fluid cytology appears to have only a moderate correlation with
      breast cancer development, methylation holds promise as a more appropriate
      biomarker, since methylation aberrations occur as an early and frequent event
      during carcinogenesis. Using quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR,
      methylation can be detected in minute amounts of DNA extracted from nipple
      aspirates, precluding the need for more invasive intraductal approaches such as
      ductal lavage and random periareolar fine needle aspiration. The application of
      genomic and proteomic diagnostics to nipple aspirates therefore provides
      unprecedented opportunities for early breast cancer diagnosis amendable to
      population-based screening.

TI  - The effect of massage on cellular immunity, endocrine and psychological factors
      in women with breast cancer -- a randomized controlled clinical trial.
PG  - 88-95
LID - 10.1016/j.autneu.2008.03.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of repeated
      effleurage massage treatments compared with a visit control group on circulating 
      lymphocytes by studying the number and activity of peripheral blood NK cells,
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in women with breast cancer. Furthermore, the effect of
      repeated effleurage massage treatments on the levels of cortisol in saliva and
      oxytocin in plasma as well as degree anxiety, depression and quality of life was 
      studied. DESIGN: A single centre, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
      SETTINGS/LOCATION: The study was conducted in a radiation department, in a
      hospital in south-western Sweden. SUBJECTS: Twenty-two women (mean age=62) with
      breast cancer undergoing radiation were included in this study. INTERVENTIONS:
      The patients were randomly assigned to effleurage massage therapy (20 min of
      effleurage on ten occasions) or to control visits (ten 20-minute visits). OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Blood samples were collected before the first and last massage/control 
      visit for analysis of peripheral blood NK, T cells and oxytocin. Saliva was
      analysed for cortisol. In addition, the patients completed the Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression Scale, Life Satisfaction Questionnaire and Spielbergers State
      Trait Anxiety Inventory prior to the first and last massage/control visit.
      RESULTS: Effleurage massage treatment had no significant effect on the number,
      frequencies or activation state of NK cells or CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Furthermore,
      no significant changes between groups were detected on cortisol and oxytocin
      concentrations, anxiety, depression or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Significant 
      effect of effleurage massage on cellular immunity, cortisol, oxytocin, anxiety,
      depression or quality of life could not be demonstrated in this study. Several
      possible explanations to the results of this study are discussed.

LID - 10.1037/1528-3542.8.2.291 [doi]
AB  - There is little extant research on the psychological or physiological response to
      witnessing good deeds. The authors call the emotional reaction to virtue "moral
      elevation" and the authors examined its effects on mother-infant dyads.
      Breastfeeding women who watched a morally elevating video were more likely to
      nurse their infants and were marginally more likely to hug them, compared to
      women who watched an equally enjoyable comedy video. Both of these effects
      suggest that moral elevation may involve the release of oxytocin, a hormone
      associated with lactation and affiliation.

TI  - Opposite effects of oxytocin on proliferation of osteosarcoma cell lines.
PG  - 50-4
LID - 10.1016/j.regpep.2008.02.007 [doi]
AB  - Oxytocin stimulates proliferation of human osteoblast-like (hOB) cells and human 
      osteosarcoma cells (SaOS-2). In contrast, oxytocin has also been shown to inhibit
      proliferation of other cell lines such as breast cancer cells. The aim of the
      present study was to investigate the effects of different concentrations of
      oxytocin on cell proliferation in osteosarcoma cell lines of different stages of 
      differentiation: SaOS-2, TE-85, and UMR-106. For this purpose cells were
      incubated with oxytocin (1-1000 pmol/l). Cell proliferation was measured by
      [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and a commercially available kit (EZ4U). Incubation
      with oxytocin during 24 h increased proliferation of SaOS-2 cells significantly
      (100 pmol/l: p<0.01). In contrast, 24 h of incubation with oxytocin decreased
      proliferation of TE-85 (100 pmol/l: p<0.01) and UMR-106 cells significantly (100 
      pmol/l: p<0.01). The effects of oxytocin in SaOS-2 and TE-85, but not in UMR-106 
      cells, were abolished when the cells were incubated with both oxytocin and an
      oxytocin antagonist (1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(Oet)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin). Instead
      incubation with the oxytocin antagonist alone decreased proliferation of UMR-106 
      cells significantly (p<0.001). Thus oxytocin has the capacity to both stimulate
      and inhibit cell proliferation of osteosarcoma cells. This effect might be
      dependent on the stage of differentiation of the cancer cells.

TI  - A critical review of pharmaceutical galactagogues.
PG  - 229-42
AB  - Use of plant and drug products to enhance lactation is widespread, and numerous
      papers have been published in the medical literature claiming efficacy for
      various products. This paper will review and evaluate the published literature on
      the most widely used pharmaceuticals that are used as galactagogues.
      Breastfeeding physiology is reviewed with the aim of creating a framework for
      understanding galactagogue pharmacology. Published articles were selected and
      evaluated using the principles of evidence-based medicine, and were also
      evaluated using the principles of good lactation management. Only three studies
      on oxytocin and seven studies on dopamine antagonists were found to be useful.
      Oxytocin is probably not useful as a galactagogue, except possibly in rare
      circumstances of tetraplegic mothers. Dopamine antagonists appear not to enhance 
      milk supply if mothers are given good lactation support and employ these
      practices. The safety of the dopamine antagonists has not been adequately
      evaluated, so their use should be avoided unless other measures have failed.

TI  - Regulator of G-protein signalling 2 mRNA is differentially expressed in mammary
      epithelial subpopulations and over-expressed in the majority of breast cancers.
PG  - R85
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To understand which signalling pathways become deregulated in
      breast cancer, it is necessary to identify functionally significant gene
      expression patterns in the stem, progenitor, transit amplifying and
      differentiated cells of the mammary epithelium. We have previously used the
      markers 33A10, CD24 and Sca-1 to identify mouse mammary epithelial cell
      subpopulations. We now investigate the relationship between cells expressing
      these markers and use gene expression microarray analysis to identify genes
      differentially expressed in the cell populations. METHODS: Freshly isolated
      primary mouse mammary epithelial cells were separated on the basis of staining
      with the 33A10 antibody and an alpha-Sca-1 antibody. The populations identified
      were profiled using gene expression microarray analysis. Gene expression patterns
      were confirmed on normal mouse and human mammary epithelial subpopulations and
      were examined in a panel of breast cancer samples and cell lines. RESULTS:
      Analysis of the separated populations demonstrated that Sca-1- 33A10High stained 
      cells were estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1)- luminal epithelial cells, whereas
      Sca-1+ 33A10Low/- stained cells were a mix of nonepithelial cells and Esr1+
      epithelial cells. Analysis of the gene expression data identified the gene Rgs2
      (regulator of G-protein signalling 2) as being highly expressed in the Sca-1-
      33A10Low/- population, which included myoepithelial/basal cells. RGS2 has
      previously been described as a regulator of angiotensin II receptor signalling.
      Gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR of cells separated on
      the basis of CD24 and Sca-1 expression confirmed that Rgs2 was more highly
      expressed in mouse myoepithelial/basal mammary cells than luminal cells. This
      expression pattern was conserved in normal human breast cells. Functional
      analysis demonstrated RGS2 to be a modulator of oxytocin receptor signalling. The
      potential significance of RGS2 expression in breast cancer was demonstrated by
      semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, data mining and quantitative real-time RT-PCR 
      approaches, which showed that RGS2 was expressed in the majority of solid breast 
      cancers at much higher levels than in normal human mammary cells. CONCLUSION:
      Molecular analysis of prospectively isolated mammary epithelial cells identified 
      RGS2 as a modulator of oxytocin receptor signalling, which is highly expressed in
      the myoepithelial cells. The RGS2 gene, but not the oxytocin receptor, was also
      shown to be over-expressed in the majority of breast cancers, identifying the
      product of this gene, or the pathway(s) it regulates, as potentially significant 
      therapeutic targets.

TI  - Parity mediates the association between infant feeding method and maternal
      depressive symptoms in the postpartum.
PG  - 259-66
AB  - Maternal depression is the most common complication of the postpartum, having
      devastating and long lasting effects on mother and infant. Lactation is
      associated with attenuated stress responses, especially that of cortisol, and the
      lactogenic hormones, oxytocin and prolactin, are associated with anti-depressant 
      and anxiolytic effects. These associations suggest that breast-feeding may
      decrease maternal depressive symptoms, yet empirical results have been
      conflicting. Recent findings have indicated that parity may mediate the
      association between breast-feeding and stress response. Because a decreased
      stress response is associated with a decreased risk for depression, parity may
      also mediate the association between infant feeding method and depressive
      symptoms. Specifically, the benefits of breast-feeding may appear in multiparous 
      but not primiparous mothers. In the present study, data drawn from a national
      sample of primiparous and multiparous mothers were examined for possible
      associations between infant feeding method and depressive symptoms, as assessed
      by the Center for Epidemiological Survey-Depression scale (CES-D). After
      controlling for several possible confounding variables, breast-feeding by
      multiparas was associated with significantly decreased odds of having depression 
      compared with bottle-feeders (OR = 0.41, CI 0.19-0.87, p = 0.02); however, no
      risk reduction from breast-feeding was evident among primiparas. The results
      support a parity-mediated association between lactation and maternal depressive
      symptoms. The results provide a reason for earlier conflicting findings, present 
      new research avenues, and suggest possible clinical approaches.

TI  - Epidural analgesia: breast-feeding success and related factors.
PG  - e31-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to compare the early breast-feeding behaviours of full-term newborns
      whose mothers had received epidural analgesia (EDA) during an uncomplicated
      labour, with a group of newborns whose mothers had not received EDA. DESIGN AND
      SETTING: a retrospective comparative study design was used and the study was
      carried out in a labour ward in Stockholm, Sweden between January 2000 and April 
      2000. The ward has about 5500 deliveries per year. PARTICIPANTS: all maternity
      records of women who had received EDA during labour (n=585) were included in the 
      study. For each EDA record, a control record was selected, matched for parity,
      age and gestational age at birth. Women with emergency caesarean section, vacuum 
      extraction/forceps, twin pregnancy, breech presentation or an intra-uterine
      death, as well as neonates with an Apgar score <7 at 5 mins were excluded. After 
      exclusion, the study population consisted of 351 healthy women and babies in each
      group. METHOD: logistic regression was performed. The dependent variables: (1)
      initiation of breast feeding after birth; (2) artificial milk given during
      hospital stay; and (3) breast feeding at discharge were studied in response to:
      (a) parity; (b) gestational age at birth; (c) length of first and second stage of
      labour; (d) administration of oxytocin; (e) administration of EDA; and (f)
      neonatal weight, as independent variables. FINDINGS: significantly fewer babies
      of mothers with EDA during labour suckled the breast within the first 4 hours of 
      life [odds ratio (OR) 3.79]. These babies were also more often given artificial
      milk during their hospital stay (OR 2.19) and fewer were fully breast fed at
      discharge (OR 1.79). Delayed initiation of breast feeding was also associated
      with a prolonged first (OR 2.81) and second stage (OR 2.49) and with the
      administration of oxytocin (OR 3.28). Fewer newborns of multiparae received
      artificial milk during their hospital stay (OR 0.58). It was also, but to a
      lesser extent, associated with oxytocin administration (OR 2.15). Full breast
      feeding at discharge was also positively associated with multiparity (OR 0.44)
      and birth weight between 3 and 4 kg (OR 0.42). KEY CONCLUSIONS: the study shows
      that EDA is associated with impaired spontaneous breast feeding including breast 
      feeding at discharge from the hospital. Further studies are needed on the effects
      of EDA on short- and long-term breast-feeding outcomes.

      due to the multiple modes of estrogen action which can now be defined by
      differing nuclear and membrane receptors for the classic ligand,
      17beta-estradiol, and by the multiple signalling pathways that are consequently
      addressed. This has led to the term xenoestrogen being largely determined by
      whatever assay system is used for its definition. Here we describe a novel and
      simple matrix for a transfection system using MBA-MD231 and MCF-7 breast cancer
      cells as hosts. This matrix is able to vary the type of nuclear estrogen receptor
      used, and by varying the promoter-reporter construct between one using a classic 
      estrogen response element (ERE) enhancer, and one using an enhancer element
      derived from the bovine oxytocin gene promoter binding an orphan nuclear
      receptor, direct classical effects can be neatly discriminated from non-classical
      and non-genomic actions of test substances. This assay matrix has been used to
      examine a selection of phytoestrogens and xenobiotics, thereby providing new
      information on the mechanism of action of some of these substances in breast
      cancer cells.

TI  - Synthesis of oxytocin HYNIC derivatives as potential diagnostic agents for breast
      cancer.
PG  - 1560-7
AB  - Two synthetic procedures for HYNIC oxytocin labeling were developed: one based on
      an orthogonal protection approach and the other with prelabeled (Boc)HYNIC-(Fmoc)
      amino acids. Both procedures were compared and applied to the preparation of
      several HYNIC-oxytocin derivatives where ligand position and amino acid (lysine
      and phenylalanine) were varied. Additionally, an oxytocin derivative labeled with
      HYNIC in the alpha-amino group of the Cys1 residue was also prepared.
      99mTc-ethylendiaminediacetic acid (EDDA) labeling efficiencies were examined for 
      all the derivatives, resulting in two candidates which showed affinity for the
      oxytocin receptor. Further biochemical experiments demonstrated that
      99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-Cys1-OT-CONH2 could be used as a potential radiopharmaceutical
      for breast cancer diagnosis.

TI  - WITHDRAWN: Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation.
PG  - CD000046
AB  - BACKGROUND: National surveys have shown that painful breasts are the second most 
      common reason for giving up breastfeeding in the first two weeks after birth in
      the UK. One factor contributing to such pain can be breast engorgement. Views
      differ as to how engorgement arises, although restrictive feeding patterns in
      hospital are likely to have contributed in the past. These differing views are
      reflected in the range of solutions offered to treat engorgement in breastfeeding
      mothers and these treatments are assessed in this review. OBJECTIVES: To
      determine the effects of any proposed intervention to relieve symptoms of breast 
      engorgement among breastfeeding women. SEARCH STRATEGY: The register of clinical 
      trials maintained and updated by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.
      CINAHL and MEDLINE were also searched. Date of last search: December 2000.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and 'quasi-randomised' controlled trials, with
      or without blinding, that assess the effectiveness of treatments for the
      alleviation of symptoms in breastfeeding women experiencing engorgement . DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a
      second reviewer. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials, involving 424 women, were included. 
      Three different studies were identified which used cabbage leaves or cabbage leaf
      extracts;. no overall benefit was found. Ultrasound treatment and placebo were
      equally effective. Use of Danzen (an anti-inflammatory agent) significantly
      improved the total symptoms of engorgement when compared to placebo (odds ratio
      (OR) 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 - 10.3) as did bromelain/trypsin
      complex (OR 8.02, 95% CI 2.8-23.3). Oxytocin and cold packs had no demonstrable
      effect on engorgement symptoms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cabbage leaves and gel
      packs were equally effective in the treatment of engorgement. Since both cabbage 
      extract and placebo cream were equally effective, the alleviation in symptoms may
      be brought about by other factors, such as breast massage. Ultrasound treatment
      is equally effective with or without the ultra-wave emitting crystal, therefore
      its effectiveness is more likely to be due to the effect of radiant heat or
      massage. Pharmacologically, oxytocin was not an effective engorgement treatment
      while Danzen and bromelain/trypsin complex significantly improved the symptoms of
      engorgement. Initial prevention of breast engorgement should remain the key
      priority.

TI  - Induction of labor with homeopathy: a case report.
PG  - 303-7
AB  - Homeopathic preparations of blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides) and black
      cohosh (Actaea racemosa [formerly Cimicifuga racemosa]) have been used around the
      world for induction and augmentation of labor. There are few clinical studies
      examining these preparations, and the evidence for their safety and efficacy is
      largely anecdotal. More research needs to be done to determine whether homeopathy
      is a potentially viable alternative to oxytocin and prostaglandins for labor
      induction.

TI  - Constitutive and ligand-induced nuclear localization of oxytocin receptor.
PG  - 96-110
AB  - Oxytocin receptor (OTR) is a membrane protein known to mediate oxytocin (OT)
      effects, in both normal and neoplastic cells. We report here that human
      osteosarcoma (U2OS, MG63, OS15 and SaOS2), breast cancer (MCF7), and primary
      human fibroblastic cells (HFF) all exhibit OTR not only on the cell membrane, but
      also in the various nuclear compartments including the nucleolus. Both an OTR-GFP
      fusion protein and the native OTR appear to be localized to the nucleus as
      detected by transfection and/or confocal immunofluorescence, respectively.
      Treatment with oxytocin causes internalization of OTR and the resulting vesicles 
      accumulate in the vicinity of the nucleus and some of the perinuclear OTR enters 
      the nucleus. Western blots indicate that OTR in the nucleus and on the plasma
      membrane are likely to be the same biochemical and immunological entities. It
      appears that OTR is first visible in the nucleoli and subsequently disperses
      within the nucleus into 4-20 spots while some of the OTR diffuses throughout the 
      nucleoplasm. The behaviour and kinetics of OTR-GFP and OTR are different,
      indicating interference by GFP in both OTR entrance into the nucleus and
      subsequent relocalization of OTR within the nucleus. There are important
      differences among the tested cells, such as the requirement of a ligand for
      transfer of OTR in nuclei. A constitutive internalization of OTR was found only
      in osteosarcoma cells, while the nuclear localization in all other tested cells
      was dependent on ligand binding. The amount of OTR-positive material within and
      in the vicinity of the nucleus increased following a treatment with oxytocin in
      both constitutive and ligand-dependent type of cells. The evidence of OTR
      compartmentalization at the cell nucleus (either ligand-dependent or
      constitutive) in different cell types suggests still unknown biological functions
      of this protein or its ligand and adds this G-protein-coupled receptor to other
      heptahelical receptors displaying this atypical and unexpected nuclear
      localization.

TI  - Brain basis of early parent-infant interactions: psychology, physiology, and in
      vivo functional neuroimaging studies.
PG  - 262-87
AB  - Parenting behavior critically shapes human infants' current and future behavior. 
      The parent-infant relationship provides infants with their first social
      experiences, forming templates of what they can expect from others and how to
      best meet others' expectations. In this review, we focus on the neurobiology of
      parenting behavior, including our own functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) brain imaging experiments of parents. We begin with a discussion of
      background, perspectives and caveats for considering the neurobiology of
      parent-infant relationships. Then, we discuss aspects of the psychology of
      parenting that are significantly motivating some of the more basic neuroscience
      research. Following that, we discuss some of the neurohormones that are important
      for the regulation of social bonding, and the dysregulation of parenting with
      cocaine abuse. Then, we review the brain circuitry underlying parenting,
      proceeding from relevant rodent and nonhuman primate research to human work.
      Finally, we focus on a study-by-study review of functional neuroimaging studies
      in humans. Taken together, this research suggests that networks of highly
      conserved hypothalamic-midbrain-limbic-paralimbic-cortical circuits act in
      concert to support aspects of parent response to infants, including the emotion, 
      attention, motivation, empathy, decision-making and other thinking that are
      required to navigate the complexities of parenting. Specifically, infant stimuli 
      activate basal forebrain regions, which regulate brain circuits that handle
      specific nurturing and caregiving responses and activate the brain's more general
      circuitry for handling emotions, motivation, attention, and empathy--all of which
      are crucial for effective parenting. We argue that an integrated understanding of
      the brain basis of parenting has profound implications for mental health.

AB  - Reduced emotional expression has been consistently related to susceptibility or
      fast progression of breast cancer. Breast cancer development and reduced
      emotional expression have both been related to rejection- and separation-related 
      conditions. The neuropeptide oxytocin is low in response to rejection or
      separation. Recent results suggest that oxytocin may protect against the
      development of breast cancer and slow its progression. In the present study, we
      investigated if individual differences in emotional expressivity relate to basal 
      or cortisol-stimulated plasma oxytocin. Healthy female subjects were treated with
      placebo or 35mg of cortisol orally in a double-blind within-subject study.
      Seventy minutes later, blood was sampled for determination of oxytocin and
      cortisol levels. We found an interaction between treatment condition and
      Emotional Expression-out scores: after cortisol treatment, oxytocin levels
      increased proportional to Emotion Expression-out score. These preliminary
      findings provide a potential mechanism for associations in the literature between
      emotional expressive behavior and breast cancer.

AB  - Colostrum is universally acknowledged as the perfect first food for infants.
      Oxytocin is the hormone of both labour and lactation but the literature shows
      that it does not always induce labour. A review of the custom of expressing
      antenatally by all women is followed by the maternal and infant medical reasons
      for expressing and storing colostrum. A suggested regime for expressing and
      storage of colostrum during pregnancy is included with advice about skin-to-skin 
      contact in the first twenty-four hours to maximise breastmilk output in the long 
      term.

AB  - The present study describes the experimental synthetic procedure and the
      characterization of a new polyaspartamide macromolecular prodrug of paclitaxel,
      bearing oxytocin residues as targeting moieties. In vitro stability studies of
      bioconjugate, performed in media mimicking biological fluids (buffer solutions at
      pH 7.4 and 5.5) and in human plasma, evidenced the high stability of the
      targeting portion (oxytocin)-polymer linkage and the ability of this conjugate to
      release linked paclitaxel in a prolonged way in plasma. Moreover, preliminary in 
      vitro antiproliferative studies, carried out on MCF-7 cells, that are oxytocin
      receptor positive cells, showed that the polymeric conjugate has the same cell
      growing inhibition ability of free drug.

TI  - Visfatin is present in bovine mammary epithelial cells, lactating mammary gland
      and milk, and its expression is regulated by cAMP pathway.
PG  - 6635-43
AB  - Visfatin was originally identified as a growth factor for immature B cells, and
      recently demonstrated to bind insulin receptor. Visfatin mRNA and protein were
      detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in cloned bovine mammary epithelial 
      cells, lactating bovine mammary gland and human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7.
      Immunocytochemical staining localized the visfatin protein in the cytosol and
      nucleus of both cells. Quantitative-RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression 
      of the visfatin mRNA was significantly elevated when treated with forskolin (500 
      microM), isopreterenol (1-10 microM) and dibutyric cyclic AMP (1 mM) for 24 h,
      and significantly reduced when treated with insulin (5-50 ng/ml) and
      dexsamethasone (0.5-250 nM) for 24 h. These results indicate that mammary
      epithelial cells express the visfatin protein and secrete them into the milk.

TI  - A randomised-controlled trial in Sweden of acupuncture and care interventions for
      the relief of inflammatory symptoms of the breast during lactation.
PG  - 184-95
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to further compare acupuncture treatment and care interventions for
      the relief of inflammatory symptoms of the breast during lactation and to
      investigate the relationship between bacteria in the breast milk and clinical
      signs and symptoms. DESIGN: randomised, non-blinded, controlled trial of
      acupuncture and care interventions. SETTING: a midwife-led breast feeding clinic 
      in Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 205 mothers with 210 cases of inflammatory symptoms of
      the breast during lactation agreed to participate. The mothers were randomly
      assigned to one of three treatment groups, two of which included acupuncture
      among the care interventions and one without acupuncture. All groups were given
      essential care. Protocols, which included scales for erythema, breast tension and
      pain, were maintained for each day of contact with the breast feeding clinic. A
      Severity Index (SI) for each mother and each day was created by adding together
      the scores on the erythema, breast tension and pain scales. The range of the SI
      was 0 (least severe) to 19 (most severe). FINDINGS: no significant difference was
      found in numbers of mothers in the treatment groups, with the lowest possible
      score for severity of symptoms on contact days 3, 4 or 5. No statistically
      significant differences were found between the treatment groups for number of
      contact days needed until the mother felt well enough to discontinue contact with
      the breast feeding clinic or for number of mothers prescribed antibiotics.
      Significant differences were found in the mean SI scores on contact days 3 and 4 
      between the non-acupuncture group and the two acupuncture groups. Mothers with
      less favourable outcomes (6 contact days, n=61) were, at first contact with the
      midwife, more often given advice on correction of the baby's attachment to the
      breast. An obstetrician was called to examine 20% of the mothers, and antibiotic 
      treatment was prescribed for 15% of the study population. The presence of Group B
      streptococci in the breast milk was related to less favourable outcomes. KEY
      CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: if acupuncture treatment is acceptable
      to the mother, this, together with care interventions such as correction of
      breast feeding position and babies' attachment to the breast, might be a more
      expedient and less invasive choice of treatment than the use of oxytocin nasal
      spray. Midwives, nurses or medical practitioners with specialist competence in
      breast feeding should be the primary care providers for mothers with inflammatory
      symptoms of the breast during lactation. The use of antibiotics for inflammatory 
      symptoms of the breast should be closely monitored in order to help the global
      community reduce resistance development among bacterial pathogens.

TI  - Newborn skin temperature two days postpartum during breastfeeding related to
      different labour ward practices.
PG  - 55-62
AB  - AIM: To investigate (1) the skin temperature pattern in newborns two days after
      birth in connection to breastfeeding and to examine (2) if the administration of 
      epidural analgesia (EDA) and oxytocin (OT) infusion during labour influences this
      parameter at this point of time. METHOD: Forty-seven mother-infant pairs were
      included in the study: nine mothers had received OT stimulation during labour (OT
      group), 20 mothers had received an EDA and OT during labour (EDA group), while 18
      mothers had received neither EDA nor OT stimulation during labour (control
      group). A skin temperature electrode was attached between the newborn's shoulder 
      blades. The newborn was placed skin-to-skin on the mother's chest and covered
      with a blanket. The temperature was recorded immediately after the newborn was
      put on the mother's chest and at 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. RESULTS: The temperature
      measured when the newborns were put skin-to-skin on their mothers' chest was
      significantly higher in the infants of the EDA group (35.07 degrees C) when
      compared to the control group (34.19 degrees C, p=0.025). Skin temperature
      increased significantly (p=0.001) during the entire experimental period in the
      infants belonging to the control group. The same response was observed in infants
      whose mothers received OT intravenously during labour (p=0.008). No such rise was
      observed in infants whose mothers were given an EDA during labour. CONCLUSION:
      The results show that the skin temperature in newborns rises when newborns are
      put skin-to-skin to breastfeed two days postpartum. This effect on temperature
      may be hampered by medical interventions during labour such as EDA.

TI  - [Oxytocin and maternal stress during the post-partum period].
PG  - 214-23
AB  - Oxytocin is required for lactation by promoting milk expulsion. Oxytocin has also
      been reported to exert a positive role in social attachment. The postpartum
      period has been shown to be crucial for maternal behavior initiation, and
      required self-trust reinforcement. However, this period is also remarkable for
      the high risk exposure of either psychic or physical stress. A negative impact on
      young mother is suspected, both in the short, medium or long term, which can even
      be deleterious for child-mother relationships. During lactation in female rats
      and sheep, oxytocin production has been proved to decrease stress-induced
      hormonal changes and later consequences. In human beings, only the first hour
      after breast-feeding seems to protect against physical or psychic stress.
      Oxytocin improves the stress-induced response by reducing the ACTH and cortisol
      secretion thus representing a potential therapeutic pathway in post-partum
      pathologies such as depression. Thus, this review of recent literature about
      oxytocin and stress during post-partum period, leads to the assumption that
      oxytocin, at the moment of installation of breastfeeding, acts not only on the
      physiological condition, but also on the psychic condition of the mother.

TI  - Oxytocin receptor signaling in myoepithelial and cancer cells.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - Oxytocin (OT) plays a crucial role as a mediator of breast myoepithelial cell
      contraction, the process responsible for the ejection of milk during lactation,
      and is also involved in myoepithelial cell proliferation and postpartum mammary
      gland proliferation. Furthermore, although a number of breast cancer cells have
      oxytocin receptors (OTRs), it has been reported that OT stimulates, inhibits, or 
      has no effect on cell proliferation. As these different effects seem to be
      mediated by different signaling pathways elicited by OTR stimulation, we here
      review the regulation of OTR signaling in different cell systems and discuss how 
      understanding the molecular basis of receptor coupling specificity has become
      extremely important for understanding the role played by OTRs in regulating cell 
      growth.

TI  - Oxytocin induces proliferation and migration in immortalized human dermal
      microvascular endothelial cells and human breast tumor-derived endothelial cells.
PG  - 351-9
AB  - Oxytocin either increases or inhibits cell growth in different cell subtypes. We 
      tested here the effect of oxytocin on cell proliferation and migration of human
      dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) and tumor-associated endothelial
      cells purified from human breast carcinomas (B-TEC). Oxytocin receptors were
      expressed in both cell subtypes at mRNA and protein levels. Through oxytocin
      receptor, oxytocin (1 nmol/L-1 mumol/L) significantly increased cell
      proliferation and migration in both HMEC and B-TEC, and addition of a selective
      oxytocin antagonist fully reverted these effects. To verify whether a different
      expression of adhesion molecule-related genes could be responsible for the
      oxytocin-induced cell migration, untreated and treated cells were compared
      applying a microarray technique. In HMEC, oxytocin induced the overexpression of 
      the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-17, cathepsin D, and integrin beta(6) genes.
      In B-TEC, oxytocin significantly switched on the gene profile of some MMP (MMP-11
      and MMP-26) and of integrin beta(6). The up-regulation of the integrin beta(6)
      gene could be involved in the oxytocin-induced cell growth, because this subunit 
      is known to determine activation of mitogen-activated protein
      kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, which is involved in the oxytocin
      mitogenic effect. In B-TEC, oxytocin also increased the expression of caveolin-1 
      at gene and protein levels. Because oxytocin receptor localization within
      caveolin-1-enriched membrane domains is necessary for activation of the
      proliferative (instead of the inhibitory) response to oxytocin, its enhanced
      expression can be involved in the oxytocin-induced B-TEC growth as well.
      Altogether, these data indicate that oxytocin contributes to cell motility and
      growth in HMEC and B-TEC.

TI  - Short-term effects of alcohol consumption on the hormonal milieu and mood states 
      in nulliparous women.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - The present study was designed to determine the short-term effects of alcohol
      consumption on hormonal responses and mood states in nulliparous women who have
      regular menstrual cycles. To this aim, we conducted a within-subjects design
      study in which eight women consumed a 0.4-g/kg dose of alcohol in orange juice
      during one test session (alcohol condition) and an equal volume of orange juice
      (control condition) during the other. Changes in plasma prolactin, oxytocin and
      cortisol levels, blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), and mood states were
      compared. BAC peaked at approximately 36.7+5.4 min after the consumption of the
      alcoholic beverage and decreased thereafter. Alcohol consumption significantly
      increased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of prolactin (P<.01) 
      and decreased the oxytocin AUC (P=.04) when compared to the control condition.
      Cortisol AUCs were not different across the two experimental conditions. Similar 
      to that previously observed in lactating women, changes in prolactin and oxytocin
      paralleled changes in feelings of drunkenness. The magnitude and persistence of
      the alcohol-induced hormonal changes in nulliparous women were significantly less
      pronounced than those observed in lactating women, further highlighting the
      dynamics of the system under study during lactation.

TI  - Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase/placental leucil Aminopeptidase (IRAP/P-lAP) and
      angiotensin IV-forming activities are modified in serum of rats with breast
      cancer induced by N-methyl-nitrosourea.
PG  - 1011-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: In previous reports, changes in oxytocinase activity in human breast 
      cancer tissue and in the serum of N-methyl-nitrosourea (NMU)-induced rat mammary 
      tumors were described. Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) has been
      identified with oxytocinase and has also been referred to as placental leucine
      aminopeptidase (P-LAP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IRAP/P-LAP activity in rat
      serum was assayed to analyze the putative role that IRAP/P-LAP may play in
      regulating mammary gland carcinogenesis induced by NMU. Furthermore, as it has
      been recently described that IRAP/P-LAP is the angiotensin IV (Ang IV) receptor
      AT4, the activities of Ang IV-forming aminopeptidase N (APN) and aminopeptidase B
      (APB) were also assayed. RESULTS: Changes in serum IRAP/P-LAP and Ang IV-forming 
      APB activities were found in rats with mammary tumors induced by NMU. Both
      activities were greatly increased, although the Ang IV-forming APN activity was
      not modified. CONCLUSION: These changes in aminopeptidase activities may reflect 
      the local functional status of their substrates, which can be selectively
      activated or inhibited in the affected tissue as a result of specific conditions 
      brought about by the tumor. Thus, these enzymatic activities may be involved in
      the promotion and progression of breast cancer through oxytocin (OT), vasopressin
      (AVP) and/or renin-angiotensin system (RAS) misregulation.

TI  - Oxytocin synthesis within the normal and neoplastic breast: first evidence of a
      local peptide source.
PG  - 1263-8
AB  - The role of the neurohypophyseal peptide oxytocin (OT) and its receptor (OTR) in 
      the breast has been described mainly in relation to breast feeding or to
      neoplastic growth regulation. We demonstrate here the presence of OT synthesis
      within the breast under both physiological and neoplastic conditions. In order to
      clarify whether normal epithelial and myoepithelial cells could synthesize OT,
      the two different cell types were separated using immunomagnetic technique after 
      enzymatic digestion of breast specimens obtained during reductive mastoplasty.
      The freshly isolated cells as well as primary stabilized cultures derived from
      purified normal breast epithelial and myopithelial cells were then studied. Both 
      epithelial and myoepithelial cells contained the mRNA for OT and OTR; however,
      only myoepithelial cells showed an effective OT synthesis and detectable peptide 
      release in the culture medium. Moreover, OT expression was studied at mRNA and
      protein level in 10 human breast carcinoma cell lines. OT mRNA was present in
      half (5 out of 10) of the breast carcinoma cell lines tested, and OT was
      synthesized and released in the cell medium, irrespective of the estrogen
      receptor status of the different cell lines. However, in the two ER+ cell lines
      actively producing OT, such synthesis was significantly increased following
      estradiol (E2) treatment. These data altogether suggest the existence of a local 
      OT source within the normal as well as within the neoplastic breast, and that
      such synthesis can be modulated by E2.

TI  - Mother and newborn baby: mutual regulation of physiology and behavior--a
      selective review.
PG  - 217-29
AB  - This article reviews 30 years of work demonstrating that interactions between
      mother and newborn infant in the period just after birth influence the physiology
      and behavior of both. Close body contact of the infant with his/her mother helps 
      regulate the newborn's temperature, energy conservation, acid-base balance,
      adjustment of respiration, crying, and nursing behaviors. Similarly, the baby may
      regulate--i.e., increase--the mother's attention to his/her needs, the initiation
      and maintenance of breastfeeding, and the efficiency of her energy economy
      through vagus activation and a surge of gastrointestinal tract hormone release
      resulting in better exploitation of ingested calories. The effects of some of
      these changes can be detected months later. Parallels to animal research and
      possible mechanisms are discussed.

TI  - Randomised, double blind trial of oxytocin nasal spray in mothers expressing
      breast milk for preterm infants.
PG  - F169-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human milk has considerable short and long term benefits for preterm 
      infants, but mothers may experience difficulties in expressing breast milk for
      infants too immature or sick to breast feed. Oxytocin has been used to assist
      breast feeding and milk expression, but few data are available to support this
      intervention in the neonatal unit setting. AIM: To test the hypothesis that
      oxytocin nasal spray increases early milk output in mothers expressing milk for
      preterm infants. METHODS: A randomised, double blind trial of oxytocin nasal
      spray (100 microl per dose) versus placebo was conducted in mothers delivering
      infants <35 weeks gestation. Sprays were used before expression of milk using an 
      electric pump up to day 5. MAIN OUTCOME: Total weight of milk expressed while
      using spray (study powered to detect >1SD difference between groups). SECONDARY
      OUTCOMES: Pattern of milk production; number of pumping sessions; weight/fat
      content of milk expressed during a fixed 20 minute period on day 5
      ("physiological study"); mother's opinion of expressing and spray assessed by
      questionnaire. RESULTS: Fifty one mothers were randomised (27 oxytocin, 24
      placebo). Total milk production did not differ between groups. Repeated measures 
      analysis of variance suggested significantly (p = 0.001) different patterns of
      milk production, with initial faster production in the oxytocin group then
      convergence between groups. Parity did not influence the response to the
      intervention. No significant differences were seen in milk weight or fat content 
      in the physiological study nor in mothers' opinions of milk expression and
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Despite marginal differences in the pattern of early milk
      production, the use of oxytocin nasal spray did not significantly improve
      outcome. Most mothers believed they were receiving the active spray, suggesting a
      significant placebo effect (supported by limited data from historical controls)
      and benefits from the extra breast feeding support available during the study.

TI  - Regulation of oxytocin secretion.
PG  - 27-58
AB  - A baby sucks at a mother's breast for comfort and, of course, for milk. Milk is
      made in specialized cells of the mammary gland, and for a baby to feed, the milk 
      must be released into a collecting chamber from where it can be extracted by
      sucking. Milk "let-down" is a reflex response to the suckling and kneading of the
      nipple--and sometimes in response to the sight, smell, and sound of the baby--and
      is ultimately affected by the secretion of oxytocin. Oxytocin has many
      physiological roles, but its only irreplaceable role is to mediate milk let-down:
      oxytocin-deficient mice cannot feed their young; the pups suckle but no milk is
      let down, and they will die unless cross-fostered. Most other physiological roles
      of oxytocin, including its role in parturition, are redundant in the sense that
      the roles can be assumed by other mechanisms in the absence of oxytocin
      throughout development and adult life. Nevertheless, physiological function in
      these roles can be altered or impaired by acute interventions that alter oxytocin
      secretion or change the actions of oxytocin. Here we focus on the diverse stimuli
      that regulate oxytocin secretion and on the apparent diversity of the roles for
      oxytocin.

TI  - Breast stimulation for cervical ripening and induction of labour.
PG  - CD003392
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast stimulation has been suggested as a means of inducing labour. 
      It is a non-medical intervention allowing women greater control over the
      induction process. This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical
      ripening and labour induction using a standardised methodology. OBJECTIVES: To
      determine the effectiveness of breast stimulation for third trimester cervical
      ripening or induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no intervention or
      other methods of induction of labour. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Pregnancy and
      Childbirth Group Trials Register (March 2004) and bibliographies of relevant
      papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Clinical trials of breast stimulation for third
      trimester cervical ripening or labour induction. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A 
      strategy was developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data
      relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data
      extraction. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials (719 women) were included. Analysis of
      trials comparing breast stimulation with no intervention found a significant
      reduction in the number of women not in labour at 72 hours (62.7% versus 93.6%,
      relative risk (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.74). This result 
      was not significant in women with an unfavourable cervix. A major reduction in
      the rate of postpartum haemorrhage was reported (0.7% versus 6%, RR 0.16, 95% CI 
      0.03 to 0.87). No significant difference was detected in the caesarean section
      rate (9% versus 10%, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.12) or rates of meconium staining.
      There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation. Three perinatal deaths were 
      reported (1.8% versus 0%, RR 8.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 147.77). When comparing breast 
      stimulation with oxytocin alone the analysis found no difference in caesarean
      section rates (28% versus 47%, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.18). No difference was
      detected in the number of women not in labour after 72 hours (58.8% versus 25%,
      RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.54) or rates of meconium staining. There were four
      perinatal deaths (17.6% versus 5%, RR 3.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 30.88). AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Breast stimulation appears beneficial in relation to the number of
      women not in labour after 72 hours, and reduced postpartum haemorrhage rates.
      Until safety issues have been fully evaluated it should not be used in high-risk 
      women. Further research is required to evaluate its safety, and should seek data 
      on postpartum haemorrhage rates, number of women not in labour at 72 hours and
      maternal satisfaction.

TI  - Psychogenic and pharmacologic induction of the let-down reflex can facilitate
      breastfeeding by tetraplegic women: a report of 3 cases.
PG  - 1261-4
AB  - Although an increasing number of women are becoming pregnant and rearing children
      after spinal cord injury (SCI), scant literature exists on breastfeeding after
      injury. In particular, it is unclear whether women with SCI above T7 can sustain 
      breastfeeding in a manner similar to neurologically intact nursing mothers. A
      functional let-down reflex is required to provide adequate milk to a nursing
      infant. Infant suckling activates tactile receptors in the breast, and this
      signal is carried via afferent nerves in the T4-6 dorsal roots to the spinal cord
      and then to neurons in the hypothalamus, which release oxytocin into the
      bloodstream. Oxytocin triggers milk ejection from the breast. Suckling-induced
      afferent stimuli are absent in women with SCI above T4 and are reduced if the
      injury is between T4 and T6. This report describes the breastfeeding practices of
      3 tetraplegic women and shows that breastfeeding can be maintained for extended
      periods (12-54 wk) after delivery. Two women required active mental imaging and
      relaxation techniques, or oxytocin nasal spray, to facilitate the let-down
      reflex. These findings suggest that although an absence of suckling-induced
      afferent stimuli may impair the let-down reflex, long-term breastfeeding can be
      maintained.

TI  - Transcriptional activation of the oxytocin promoter by oestrogens uses a novel
      non-classical mechanism of oestrogen receptor action.
PG  - 197-207
AB  - Transcriptional activation of the gene coding for the neuropeptide hormone
      oxytocin by oestrogens does not follow the classical model of oestrogen receptor 
      action. The oxytocin promoter does not contain an oestrogen response element
      (ERE), but instead a high-affinity binding site for nuclear orphan receptors. In 
      the present study, the oestrogen-dependent up-regulation of the bovine oxytocin
      promoter is investigated in MDA-MB 231 cells. Control by oestrogen is shown to be
      dependent on the integrity of the nuclear orphan receptor binding site and the
      presence of ligand-activated oestrogen receptor, but independent of oestrogen
      receptor binding to DNA. Partial agonists tamoxifen and raloxifen and the pure
      antagonist ICI 182 780 all show agonistic activities on transcription, while
      exhibiting normal binding affinities to oestrogen receptor (ER)alpha. Nuclear
      orphan receptors oestrogen receptor-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) and germ
      cell nuclear factor (GCNF) are expressed to significant levels in MDA-MB 231
      cells. Binding of ERRalpha to the oxytocin promoter binding site can be
      demonstrated, suggesting the involvement of this nuclear orphan receptor in
      oestrogen-dependent up-regulation. The oestrogenic stimulation of the oxytocin
      promoter apparently is dependent on the stimulation of the transcriptional
      activity of this nuclear orphan receptor by ERK-1/ERK-2 mitogen-activated protein
      kinases (MAP kinases). This novel nonclassical mechanism of oestrogen action most
      probably is not restricted to the regulation of neuropeptide hormone expression, 
      but may further contribute to the multitude of tissue-specific effects of
      oestrogenic substances.

TI  - Identifying newborns at risk of significant hyperbilirubinaemia: a comparison of 
      two recommended approaches.
PG  - 415-21
AB  - AIMS: To compare the predictive performance of clinical risk factor assessment
      and pre-discharge bilirubin measurement as screening tools for identifying
      infants at risk of developing significant neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia
      (post-discharge total serum bilirubin (TSB) >95th centile). METHODS:
      Retrospective cohort study of term and near term infants born in an urban
      community teaching hospital in Pennsylvania (1993-97). A clinical risk factor
      scoring system was developed and its predictive performance compared to a
      pre-discharge TSB expressed as a risk zone on a bilirubin nomogram. Main outcome 
      measures were prediction model discrimination, range of predicted probabilities, 
      and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and
      likelihood ratios for various positivity criteria. RESULTS: The clinical risk
      factor scoring system developed included birth weight, gestational age <38 weeks,
      oxytocin use during delivery, vacuum extraction, breast feeding, and combination 
      breast and bottle feeding. The pre-discharge bilirubin risk zone had better
      discrimination (c = 0.83; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.86) than the clinical risk factor
      score (c = 0.71; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.76) and predicted risk of significant
      hyperbilirubinaemia as high as 59% compared with a maximum of 44% for the
      clinical risk factor score. Neither the risk score nor the pre-discharge TSB risk
      zone predicted the outcome with > or =0.98 sensitivity without significantly
      compromising specificity (0.13 and 0.21, respectively). Multi-level clinical risk
      factor scores and TSB risk zones produced likelihood ratios of 0.15-3.25 and
      0.05-9.43, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pre-discharge bilirubin expressed as a 
      risk zone on an hour specific bilirubin nomogram is more accurate and generates
      wider risk stratification than a clinical risk factor score.

TI  - Alcohol and the hormonal control of lactation.
PG  - 178-84
AB  - All mammals produce milk to nourish their young. Milk production (i.e.,
      lactation), which occurs in the mammary glands, is regulated by several hormones,
      most prominently prolactin and oxytocin. Studies in both humans and laboratory
      animals have demonstrated that maternal alcohol consumption before and during
      lactation can interfere with the functions of both of those hormones. Moreover,
      animal studies found that maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and even 
      earlier in the mother's life can impair mammary gland development. Maternal
      alcohol consumption during pregnancy and lactation also can alter the milk's
      nutrient composition and result in suckling deficits of the offspring. Alcohol
      (and possibly its breakdown products) can pass from the maternal circulation into
      the breast milk. The effects of these substances on the infant, however, are
      still unknown.

TI  - Oxytocin induces dephosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 in human
      myometrial cells.
PG  - 2265-70
AB  - The oxytocin (OT) receptor (OTR) mediates a wide spectrum of biological actions
      and is expressed in a large number of different tissues, including uterine,
      breast, and lung tumors. To define more completely the intracellular signaling
      mechanisms linked to OTR activation, we have used a phosphoproteomics approach
      and have characterized changes in the phosphorylation states of intracellular
      proteins in response to OTR activation in OTR-expressing cell lines. Using a
      specific antiphosphothreonine antibody, we observed several distinct changes in
      the threonine phosphorylation patterns. The most prominent change involved
      dephosphorylation of a 95-kDa moiety. Purification by ion exchange chromatography
      combined with one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
      followed by N-terminal micro-sequence analysis revealed that the 95-kDa moiety
      corresponded to eukaryotic elongation factor 2. This protein is a key regulator
      of cellular protein synthesis and mediates, upon dephosphorylation, the
      translocation step of peptide chain elongation. Dose-response curves in
      myometrial cells expressing the endogenous OTR indicated a significant effect of 
      OT on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 dephosphorylation at 1 nM, a concentration
      close to the dissociation constant (K(d)) of OT. Time course analysis indicates
      that the effect is rapid with a significant effect occurring at 5 min. To
      determine directly the effect of OT on protein synthesis, the incorporation of
      [35S]Met into total protein was assessed. In myometrial cells, OTR activation led
      to significant 29% increase in total protein synthesis over a 2-h period. These
      findings establish a novel link between OTR activation and cellular protein
      synthesis and thus define a mechanism by which OT assumes a so far unrecognized, 
      physiologically relevant trophic function.

TI  - Regulation of iodide uptake and sodium/iodide symporter expression in the mcf-7
      human breast cancer cell line.
PG  - 2321-6
AB  - Sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) expression has recently been described in human
      breast cancer, with emphasis on its potential exploitation for the treatment of
      these tumors with radioiodine. In this study, we analyzed the regulation of NIS
      expression and function in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Cell exposure
      to insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, or prolactin induced significant increases in 125I
      uptake and the expression of both NIS mRNA and NIS protein. The latter increases 
      were evident after 6 and 12 h of hormonal stimulation, respectively. In
      immunocytochemistry studies, NIS was detected mainly in the plasma membrane of
      MCF-7 cells. A low but significant increase in iodide uptake was produced by
      treatment with activators of the adenylyl cyclase (cAMP) or protein kinase C
      pathways. Our study demonstrates that: 1) MCF-7 breast cancer cells are capable
      of active iodide transport that can be stimulated by insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, or
      prolactin; 2) both NIS transcript and protein are expressed in these cells, and
      this expression is also hormonally stimulated; and 3) MCF-7 iodide transport and 
      NIS expression may be influenced by the activation of cAMP or protein kinase
      C-dependent signaling. These findings increase our understanding of the molecular
      mechanisms that regulate NIS expression in breast cancer cells, information that 
      is fundamental for future research aimed at the development of targeted
      radioiodide treatment for this type of cancer.

TI  - Acute alcohol consumption disrupts the hormonal milieu of lactating women.
PG  - 1979-85
AB  - Despite the lack of scientific evidence to support the claim that alcohol is a
      galactagogue, lactating women have been advised to drink alcohol as an aid to
      lactation for centuries. To test the hypothesis that alcohol consumption affects 
      the hormonal response in lactating women, we conducted a within-subjects design
      study in which 17 women consumed a 0.4 g/kg dose of alcohol in orange juice
      during one test session and an equal volume of orange juice during the other.
      Changes in plasma prolactin, oxytocin, and cortisol levels during and after
      breast stimulation, lactational performance, and mood states were compared under 
      the two experimental conditions. Oxytocin levels significantly decreased, whereas
      prolactin levels and measures of sedation, dysphoria, and drunkenness
      significantly increased, during the immediate hours after alcohol consumption.
      Changes in oxytocin were related to measures of lactational performance such as
      milk yield and ejection latencies, whereas changes in prolactin were related to
      self-reported measures of drunkenness. Although alcohol consumption resulted in
      significantly higher cortisol when compared with the control condition, cortisol 
      levels were not significantly correlated with any of the indices of lactational
      performance or self-reported drug effects. Moreover, cortisol levels steadily
      decreased on the control day, indicating that the procedures were not stressful
      to the subjects. In conclusion, recommending alcohol as an aid to lactation may
      be counterproductive. In the short term, mothers may be more relaxed, but the
      hormonal milieu underlying lactational performance is disrupted, and, in turn,
      the infant's milk supply is diminished.

TI  - Endocrinology of lactation.
PG  - 963-79, xii
AB  - The endocrine control of lactation is one of the most complex physiologic
      mechanisms of human parturition. Mammogenesis, lactogenesis, galactopoiesis, and 
      galactokinesis are all essential to assure proper lactation. Prolactin is the key
      hormone of lactation and seems to be the single most important galactopoietic
      hormone. Oxytocin, serotonin, opioids, histamine, substance P, and
      arginine-leucine modulate prolactin release by means of an autocrine/paracrine
      mechanism, whereas estrogen and progesterone hormones can act at the hypothalamic
      and adenohypophysial levels. Human placental lactogen and growth factors play an 
      essential role to assure successful lactation during pregnancy. Oxytocin is the
      most powerful galactokinetic hormone.

TI  - [Lactation and alcohol: clinical and nutritional effects].
PG  - 25-35
AB  - Researchers have turned their attention to the effects of alcohol consumption on 
      breastfeeding, with significant negative findings concerning both the mother and 
      the newborn. This study is a meta-analysis of the principle research performed in
      the last decade that was concerned with lactation and alcohol. Results from
      experimental and human subject research has shown that effects of alcohol
      include: behavioural changes, reduced milk and luteinising hormone production,
      with increased fat content, reduced lactose content. Increased lipogenesis and
      increased activity of lipoprotein and hormone-sensitive lipase, structural
      alterations in the epithelial cells of the breast and abnormal casein production,
      reduced oxytocin and prolactin production with subsequent reduced milk ejection, 
      and reduced weight and protein content of the breast. Reduction in food
      consumption, body weight, growth and development and hepatic glycogen, serum
      glucose, amino-acids, insulin, glycerol, fatty acids and urea, and an increase in
      serum acetoacetic acid is seen in newborn children that were breastfed by animals
      with a high intake of alcohol during pregnancy or the puerperal period. Alcohol
      consumption during lactation caused a reduction in liver weight and triglyceride,
      protein, DNA and lipid content, in the newborns. Serum changes included a
      reduction in protein, triglyceride, cholesterol, fatty acid and glycerol level
      with an increase in beta-hydroxybutirate levels. Changes also included
      alterations in the motor system and behaviour. Further studies are needed to
      determine, with confidence, the minimum level of alcohol consumption that can
      provoke pathological effects in both the mother and the child.

TI  - Serum oxytocinase activity is related to tumor growth parameters in N-methyl
      nitrosourea induced rat breast cancer.
PG  - 1369-77
AB  - Oxytocinase has been reported to hydrolyse the peptide hormone oxytocin (OT). We 
      have previously described changes in oxytocinase activity in human breast cancer,
      where a highly significant increase occurred in tumoral tissue. In the present
      work, we analysed oxytocinase activity in serum of rats with breast cancer
      induced by N-methyl-nitrosourea (NMU). We also correlated these data with the
      number and size of tumors and the body weight of the animals to evaluate the
      putative value of this activity as a biological marker of the disease. Our
      results confirm the involvement of OT in carcinogenesis and suggest a mayor role 
      for oxytocinase activity in the development of breast cancer.

TI  - [Extracellular ATP mediated mechano-signaling in mammary glands].
PG  - 397-402
AB  - ATP, an important and ubiquitous extracellular signaling molecule, is often
      released by mechanical stimuli and plays an essential role in mechano-signaling. 
      In lactating mammary glands, secretory epithelial (SE) cells form alveoli in
      which milk is held, and myoepithelial (ME) cells surrounding the alveoli contract
      in response to oxytocin to expel milk. Previously we found that the contraction
      of ME cells worked as a mechanical stress to SE cells and caused ATP-release in
      cultured mammary epithelial cells. The released ATP activated P2Y2 in surrounding
      SE cells and P2Y1 in ME cells. We already reported that ATP synergistically
      enhanced oxytocin response in ME cells. These findings mean that ME and SE cells 
      interact mutually via released ATP to enhance the milk ejection. Recently, we
      found that cell-stretch also induced Ca(2+)-increases and ATP-release. The
      stretching of alveoli should occur by milk filling. So, only the milk-filled
      alveoli (but not empty alveoli) are surrounded by ATP. The ATP lowers the
      threshold of the oxytocin receptors and enables the milk-filled alveoli to
      contract in response to oxytocin at a concentration in the blood. Slight but
      apparent constitutive-ATP-release was observed in non-stimulated cells and the
      release was enhanced in Ca(2+)-free solution. The pathway of ATP-release is not
      yet clear, but pharmacologically, there seems to be two or more pathways.

PG  - 73-6
AB  - Between 1995 and 2003 a total of 1 827 women suffering from puerperal mastitis
      was studied. Etiology of the disease was defined, white cell counts and
      microbiologic cultures were obtained. According to the results the illness was
      classified and treated. Since in all cases we found either simple congestion or
      non-infectious inflammation of the breast treatment consisted of intensified
      emptying of the breast by breast feeding every 2 hours and in some cases
      additional manual expression of milk. Antibiotics and bromocriptine were not
      used. In 1 826 cases fever and flue symptoms had resolved within 25-36 hours.
      Redness and soreness had resolved within 2-3 days. Relapse did not occur and none
      of the women developed an abscess. One woman had to be treated with antibiotics
      because the baby refused to nurse at the diseased breast and emptying had to be
      done by hand.

TI  - From galactorrhea to osteopenia: rethinking serotonin-prolactin interactions.
PG  - 833-46
AB  - The widespread use of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has
      been accompanied by numerous reports describing a potential association with
      hyperprolactinemia. Antipsychotics are commonly known to elevate serum prolactin 
      (PRL) through blockade of dopamine receptors in the pituitary. However, there is 
      little awareness of the mechanisms by which SSRIs stimulate PRL release.
      Hyperprolactinemia may result in overt symptoms such as galactorrhea, which may
      be accompanied by impaired fertility. Long-term clinical sequelae include
      decreased bone density and the possibility of an increased risk of breast cancer.
      Through literature review, we explore the possible pathways involved in
      serotonin-induced PRL release. While the classic mechanism of
      antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia directly involves dopamine cells in the 
      tuberoinfundibular pathway, SSRIs may act on this system indirectly through
      GABAergic neurons. Alternate pathways involve serotonin stimulation of vasoactive
      intestinal peptide (VIP) and oxytocin (OT) release. We conclude with a
      comprehensive review of clinical sequelae associated with hyperprolactinemia, and
      the potential role of SSRIs in this phenomenon.

TI  - Effects of acupuncture and care interventions on the outcome of inflammatory
      symptoms of the breast in lactating women.
PG  - 56-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare modes of care and treatment for lactating women with
      inflammatory symptoms of the breast, with special focus on the use of
      acupuncture. METHOD: Eighty-eight mothers were randomized into three treatment
      groups. All three groups were given advice regarding emptying of the breasts and 
      care in the form of comfort interventions. Acupuncture was included in the
      treatment regime for two of the groups. A severity index was created by adding
      together scores for signs and symptoms: breast tension, erythema and pain.
      FINDINGS: Mothers in all groups expressed relative satisfaction with the
      breastfeeding situation despite considerable discomfort. There was no significant
      difference between the groups for the number of mothers requiring more than three
      contact days for recovery nor for their severity index scores on day 3. These
      findings must be interpreted with care but may suggest that care interventions
      play as great a part in the recovery of these women as acupuncture treatment or
      the use of oxytocin spray. Antibiotic therapy was used in 9% of the study
      population, which is in contrast to other studies. PROPOSED FUTURE ACTION: Based 
      on these results, a new study has been designed to test the hypothesis that
      acupuncture hastens recovery from inflammatory processes in the lactating breast 
      and approximately 200 mothers will be randomized in a new expanded study.

TI  - Ultrasound imaging of milk ejection in the breast of lactating women.
PG  - 361-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Currently, the methods for assessing milk ejection in women include
      serial sampling of plasma oxytocin and measurement of intraductal pressure, both 
      of which are invasive and may induce stress. We hypothesized that milk ejection
      would cause an increase in milk-duct diameter that could be observed
      noninvasively with ultrasound, and this could be used to investigate the
      physiology of milk ejection in women. METHODS: One milk duct was scanned in the
      unsuckled breast in 2 groups of mothers: group BB (n = 21) for the beginning of a
      breastfeed and group EB (n = 24) for the entire breastfeed. A duct also was
      monitored for a 5-minute period on 2 separate days in the absence of factors that
      may induce milk ejection in group EB to provide a baseline duct diameter. Milk
      intake at a breastfeed was measured by test weighing. RESULTS: A significant
      increase in milk-duct diameter was observed when milk ejection was sensed and/or 
      the infant changed its swallowing pattern in both groups. Multiple increases and 
      decreases (mean: 2.5 per breastfeed; standard deviation: 1.5; n = 62) in duct
      diameter occurred in group EB. Duct diameter remained relatively stable between
      breastfeeds (coefficient of variation: 1.4%-8.3%). Infant milk intake was
      positively related to the number of milk ejections (r2 =.365; n = 57).
      CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound is an objective, noninvasive technique for detecting milk
      ejection by observing an increase in milk-duct diameter. However, this technique 
      requires an experienced ultrasonographer, adequate imaging time, and surroundings
      conducive to breastfeeding. Multiple milk ejections were common during
      breastfeeding, although they were not sensed by mothers. The number of milk
      ejections influenced the amount of milk the infant consumed.

TI  - Effects of oxytocin outside pregnancy.
PG  - 262-71
AB  - For a long time, oxytocin was regarded as a pregnancy hormone released by the
      hypophysis to stimulate labour and milk ejection. In the present survey, data
      have been collected from the literature to show the spectrum of the hitherto
      known functions of oxytocin outside pregnancy. It is now known that oxytocin
      receptors can occur almost ubiquitously in the organism, that oxytocin is also
      formed outside of the brain and that oxytocin has functions in a number of
      organs. In the first part of the survey, stimuli that contribute to an increase
      in oxytocin release are compiled. In the second part, details are given on the
      individual oxytocin targets. Although the majority of findings are based on the
      results of animal experiments, there are already a number of studies that
      indicate similar effects of oxytocin in humans. According to the current state of
      knowledge, oxytocin appears to be involved in functions in the following organs: 
      male and non-pregnant female reproductive tract, pancreas, cardiovascular system,
      kidney, brain and breast. There are indications that oxytocin may also have
      actions in other organs. There continues to be a considerable need for research
      into oxytocin in order to better understand the physiological and
      pathophysiological actions and to be able to derive possible therapeutic uses.
      Further light on the spectrum of functions of oxytocin may be cast by the
      possibility of the use of oxytocin antagonists.

TI  - Improved radiotracing of oxytocin receptor-expressing tumours using the new
      [111In]-DOTA-Lys8-deamino-vasotocin analogue.
PG  - 930-6
AB  - Oxytocin receptors (OTR) have been described in a number of tumours of different 
      origin, and represent a new target for specific radiolabelled oxytocin (OT)
      analogues in cancer diagnosis and therapy. By linking the DOTA chelating agent to
      position 8 of the deamino derivative of Lys(8)-vasotocin (dLVT), we obtained a
      new compound (DOTA-dLVT) with the following characteristics: (1) it forms a
      monomeric and stable compound that binds to OTR with an affinity comparable to
      that of the endogenous OT ligand; (2) it is characterised by a very good
      selectivity profile for the human OTR, with a low affinity binding to the closely
      related V1a, V1b and V2 vasopressin receptor subtypes; (3) it induces rapid and
      persistent receptor internalisation and (4) when radiolabelled,
      [(111)In]-DOTA-dLVT is efficiently and selectively taken up by OTR-positive
      tumours grown in mice. These features makes radiolabelled DOTA-dLVT a very good
      candidate for the radiotargeting of OTR-expressing tumours.

TI  - Diminished milk synthesis in upstream stimulatory factor 2 null mice is
      associated with decreased circulating oxytocin and decreased mammary gland
      expression of eukaryotic initiation factors 4E and 4G.
PG  - 2251-67
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that upstream stimulatory factors (USFs) regulate
      genes involved with cell cycle progression. Because of the relationship of USFs
      to an important oncogene in breast cancer, c-myc, we chose to determine the
      importance of USF to normal mammary gland development in the mouse. Expression of
      USF in the mammary gland throughout development demonstrated only modest changes.
      Mutation of the Usf2 gene was associated with reduced fertility in females, but
      had no effect on prepartum mammary gland development. However, lactation
      performance in Usf2-/- females was only half of that observed in Usf2+/+ females,
      and both lactose and nitrogen were decreased in milk from Usf2-/- dams. This
      decrease was associated with diminished mammary tissue wet weight and luminal
      area by d 9 of lactation and with a decreased protein-DNA ratio. This decrease
      was associated with reduced abundance of the eukaryotic initiation factors eIF4E 
      and eIF4G. Blood oxytocin concentrations on d 9 postpartum were also lower in
      Usf2-/- mice than Usf2+/+ mice. In contrast, the mutation had no effect on blood 
      prolactin concentrations, mammary cell proliferation or apoptosis, mammary tissue
      oxytocin receptors, or milk protein gene expression. The mutation had only modest
      effects on maternal behavior. These data support the idea that USF is important
      to physiological processes necessary for the establishment and maintenance of
      normal lactation and suggest that USF-2 may impact lactation through both
      systemic and mammary cell-specific mechanisms.

PG  - 266-8
AB  - It has been shown that early detection of breast cancer saves lives. Recently
      there has been increasing interest in nipple aspirate fluid as a potential avenue
      for breast cancer diagnosis. One major challenge regarding studies of nipple
      aspirate fluid is the ability to obtain adequate samples. Here we describe the
      use of nasal oxytocin in a group of volunteer women in order to increase the
      yield of nipple aspirate fluid.

TI  - The oxytocin receptor.
PG  - 222-7
AB  - Novel sites of oxytocin receptor expression have recently been detected,
      including breast cancer cells, bone cells, myoblasts, cardiomyocytes and
      endothelial cells. These discoveries have greatly expanded the possible spectrum 
      of oxytocin action beyond its classic role as an inducer of uterine contractions 
      and milk ejection. Additional advances in the understanding of oxytocin receptor 
      structure-function relationships, receptor trafficking and novel receptor-linked 
      signaling cascades have made this receptor an attractive model for the study of
      G-protein-linked receptor function. Finally, the tocolytic efficiency of the
      oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban, recently approved for clinical use in
      Europe, has opened new avenues for the prevention and treatment of preterm labor.

TI  - Methods for cervical ripening and induction of labor.
PG  - 2123-8
AB  - Induction of labor is common in obstetric practice. According to the most current
      studies, the rate varies from 9.5 to 33.7 percent of all pregnancies annually. In
      the absence of a ripe or favorable cervix, a successful vaginal birth is less
      likely. Therefore, cervical ripening or preparedness for induction should be
      assessed before a regimen is selected. Assessment is accomplished by calculating 
      a Bishop score. When the Bishop score is less than 6, it is recommended that a
      cervical ripening agent be used before labor induction. Nonpharmacologic
      approaches to cervical ripening and labor induction have included herbal
      compounds, castor oil, hot baths, enemas, sexual intercourse, breast stimulation,
      acupuncture, acupressure, transcutaneous nerve stimulation, and mechanical and
      surgical modalities. Of these nonpharmacologic methods, only the mechanical and
      surgical methods have proven efficacy for cervical ripening or induction of
      labor. Pharmacologic agents available for cervical ripening and labor induction
      include prostaglandins, misoprostol, mifepristone, and relaxin. When the Bishop
      score is favorable, the preferred pharmacologic agent is oxytocin.

TI  - Molecular regulation of the oxytocin receptor in peripheral organs.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - The oxytocin receptor belongs to the G-protein-coupled seven transmembrane
      receptor superfamily. Its main physiological role is regulating the contraction
      of uterine smooth muscle at parturition and the ejection of milk from the
      lactating breast. Oxytocin receptor expression is observed not only in the
      myometrium and mammary gland but also in the endometrium, decidua, ovary, testis,
      epididymis, vas deferens, thymus, heart and kidney, as well as in the brain. The 
      expression profile shows a tissue-specific as well as a stage-specific pattern.
      The oxytocin receptor gene is a single-copy gene consisting of four exons and
      three introns, localized at 3p25-3p26.2 in the human chromosome. In transfection 
      studies using a fusion construct containing the promoter region of the oxytocin
      receptor gene inserted in a reporter plasmid, neither proinflammatory cytokines
      nor oestrogen directly activate the gene. The nuclear fractions from up-regulated
      (term myometrium) and down-regulated (non-pregnant myometrium) tIssues show
      differential patterns of protein binding to the 5'-flanking region, and a human
      homologue of chicken MafF has been cloned as a term-myometrium-specific oxytocin 
      receptor modulator. The oxytocin receptor gene appears to be highly methylated.
      Methylation around intron 1 and in intron 3 might contribute to tIssue-specific
      suppression of the gene. The oxytocin receptor is also regulated by
      desensitization, whose mechanism appears to involve loss of ligand-binding
      activity of the protein as well as suppression of the oxytocin receptor mRNA
      transcription. These findings taken together indicate that the oxytocin receptor 
      is regulated in a very complicated manner, and the transcriptional regulatory
      elements critical for this regulation should be investigated further.

TI  - Breast-feeding and maternal health in online mothers.
PG  - 299-309
AB  - Self-reports of mothers currently breast-feeding (n = 561) and mothers who had
      breast-fed in the past (n = 452) were compared for perceived stress, self-reports
      of upper respiratory infection symptoms, and physician visits for psychological
      illnesses. Possible demographic confounds were controlled statistically. In
      analyses examining breast-feeding status as a dichotomous variable (current vs.
      past), breast-feeding was negatively associated with perceived stress and upper
      respiratory symptoms (the latter association dissolved when controlling for
      perceived stress), but not with physician visits for psychological illnesses.
      However, analyses of the continuous variables of frequency of breast-feeding and 
      cumulative amount of breast-feeding revealed negative associations, and analyses 
      of times since last nursing revealed positive associations with likelihood for
      physician visits for psychological illnesses. Frequency of bottle-feeding was
      positively associated with perceived stress. The results support the
      interrelatedness of breast-feeding and maternal health in online mothers.

TI  - Increased gene expression of endothelin-1 and vasoactive intestinal
      contractor/endothelin-2 in the mammary gland of lactating mice.
PG  - 1339-43
AB  - In an attempt to understand the roles of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and vasoactive
      intestinal contractor/endothelin-2 (VIC/ET-2), we have studied the genes for both
      peptides to be expressed in the mammary gland of lactating mice. We observed
      through real-time PCR analysis that ET-1 and VIC/ET-2 gene expression gradually
      increase after parturition and that ET-1 gene expression is significantly higher 
      than that of VIC/ET-2. The distribution of ET-1 peptide was found to be localized
      mainly in the epithelial cells of the mammary gland at 14th day of lactation.
      ET-1 gene expression increases significantly, parallel to the increase in
      beta-casein gene expression, in epithelial cell lines (HC11) of mouse mammary
      gland after hormonal stimulation by addition of dexamethazone and prolactin. The 
      observed increase in ET-1 expression in differentiated epithelial cells suggests 
      physiological roles for ET-1, including milk production and secretion in the
      mammary gland of lactating mice.

TI  - Breast-feeding and maternal cardiovascular function.
PG  - 988-97
AB  - Two studies examined the effects of breast-feeding on maternal cardiovascular
      function. In the first experiment, groups of breast-feeding and bottle-feeding
      women were compared on preejection period (PEP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output 
      (CO), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) recorded for 1-min periods before and
      during standard laboratory stressors. Compared with bottle-feeders,
      breast-feeders had higher CO throughout the session, and greater decreases in CO 
      and increases in TPR during cold pressor. In the second experiment, HR and blood 
      pressure (BP) were compared before and after one breast-feeding and one
      bottle-feeding session in a within-subjects design. Both feeding methods
      increased BP but decreased HR, and systolic BP was higher for the breast-feeding 
      than the bottle-feeding condition. Both studies support the notion that
      breast-feeding alters maternal cardiovascular function, possibly through the
      actions of oxytocin.

TI  - Galactorrhoea following acupuncture.
PG  - 107-8
AB  - A 41-year-old woman with breast cancer was referred to the pain management clinic
      for a course of acupuncture for intense pain following a subcutaneous mastectomy 
      and a latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction. She was treated with a standard
      course of acupuncture for breast pain, using paravertebral segmental points,
      trigger points, plus contralateral L14 on the non-lymphoedematous arm. She
      experienced an episode of galactorrhoea six days following the first treatment
      and during the second treatment. She had not previously lactated for four years. 
      CT and MRI of the brain revealed no focal abnormality. Acupuncture has been used 
      in to promote lactation in the Traditional Chinese literature using the
      'Tianzong' acupoint SI11. This acupoint coincided with a trigger point over
      infraspinatus that was included in the neurophysiologically based acupuncture
      treatment. Quantitative analysis has shown an increase in the production of
      prolactin and oxytocin following acupuncture. These hormones are involved in the 
      synthesis and release of milk from mammary glands respectively. This is the first
      report of galactorrhoea, in the contralateral normal breast, following
      acupuncture in a patient with breast cancer.

TI  - Galactogogues: medications that induce lactation.
PG  - 274-9
AB  - Galactogogues are medications that aid in initiating and maintaining adequate
      milk production. Most exert their pharmacologic effects through interactions with
      dopamine receptors, resulting in increased prolactin levels and thereby
      augmenting milk supply. Metoclopramide remains the galactogogue of choice due to 
      its documented record of efficacy and safety in women and infants. Domperidone
      crosses the blood brain barrier and into the breast milk to a lesser extent than 
      metoclopramide, decreasing the risk of toxicity to both mother and infant
      possibly making it an attractive alternative. Traditional antipsychotics,
      sulpiride and chlorpromazine, have been evaluated, but adverse events limit their
      use. Human growth hormone, thyrotrophin-releasing hormone, and oxytocin have also
      been studied. Finally, a natural product, fenugreek, has been purported to be
      effective in anecdotal reports. Use of this agent may be warranted after
      considering risks versus benefits.

TI  - Estradiol and progesterone regulate oxytocin receptor binding and expression in
      human breast cancer cell lines.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - The effects of estradiol (E2) and progesterone on the oxytocin receptor (OTR)
      were investigated in MCF-7 and Hs 578T human breast cancer cell lines. OTR
      messenger RNA and protein were identified by reverse transcriptase polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) and solution-phase hybridization-RNase protection assay, and
      Western blot analysis, respectively, in cell lines and in cancerous breast tissue
      removed from women at mastectomy. Cells were exposed to E2, progesterone, or
      vehicle (each steroid, 10(-10)-10(-6) M) for 24 h and harvested for extraction of
      RNA. The OTR PCR product was increased by E2 (10(-7) M, p < 0.05, or 10(-6) M, p 
      < 0.01 vs control) and decreased by progesterone (control vs 10(-7) or 10(-6) M, 
      each p < 0.005). Hs578T cells were cultured in the presence or absence of E2
      (10(-6) M) or progesterone (10(-6) M) for 24 h and binding was measured. For the 
      E2-exposed cells, the Kd (p < 0.05), and Bmax (p < 0.01) were higher whereas for 
      the progesterone-treated cells the Kd (p < 0.05) and Bax were lower than control 
      cells. E2 and progesterone not only regulate OTR expression and binding in normal
      mammary myoepithelium but also in malignant mammary cell lines.

TI  - Hormonal regulation of mammary differentiation and milk secretion.
PG  - 49-66
AB  - The endocrine system coordinates development of the mammary gland with
      reproductive development and the demand of the offspring for milk. Three
      categories of hormones are involved. The levels of the reproductive hormones,
      estrogen, progesterone, placental lactogen, prolactin, and oxytocin, change
      during reproductive development or function and act directly on the mammary gland
      to bring about developmental changes or coordinate milk delivery to the
      offspring. Metabolic hormones, whose main role is to regulate metabolic responses
      to nutrient intake or stress, often have direct effects on the mammary gland as
      well. The important hormones in this regard are growth hormone, corticosteroids, 
      thyroid hormone, and insulin. A third category of hormones has recently been
      recognized, mammary hormones. It currently includes growth hormone, prolactin,
      PTHrP, and leptin. Because a full-term pregnancy in early life is associated with
      a reduction in breast carcinogenesis, an understanding of the mechanisms by which
      these hormones bring about secretory differentiation may offer clues to the
      prevention of breast cancer.

TI  - Oxytocin modulates estrogen receptor alpha expression and function in MCF7 human 
      breast cancer cells.
PG  - 375-8
AB  - Oxytocin (OT) inhibits the proliferation of MCF7 estrogen-dependent human breast 
      cancer cells, via specific OT receptors (OTR). Besides this effect, we report
      that OT modulates the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in MCF7
      cells, both at mRNA and protein level. Since the first 24 h of OT treatment the
      ERalpha mRNA levels are down-regulated; in contrast, ERalpha protein expression
      decreases at a later time. The reduced number of ERalpha goes in parallel to a
      temporary increase in the binding affinity of these receptors as well as to a
      significant increase in their estradiol (E2)-induced transcription activity. The 
      increase in both binding affinity and transcriptional activity of ERalpha likely 
      balances the reduction in the number of ERalpha binding sites, ruling out the
      hypothesis that part of the OT contrasting effect on E2-induced cell
      proliferation could depend on the reduced E2 binding to MCF7 cells and supporting
      the hypothesis of an exclusively direct OT-antimitogenic effect. This is the
      first evidence that OT modulates the expression of ERalpha receptors in human
      neoplastic cells.

TI  - Infant feeding practices in complex emergencies: a case study approach.
PG  - 231-8
AB  - The majority of deaths associated with complex emergencies are attributed to
      infants and children under the age of five years. Most of these deaths are
      related to preventable diseases such as malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria.
      Infant feeding emergencies have emerged as a major factor in complex emergencies.
      This paper reviews the current information relative to infant feeding, and uses
      four case studies as educational tools for the management of infant feeding
      emergencies. Child mortality rates in refugee population have been linked
      directly to protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). Breast feeding has many advantages
      over all other forms of feeding for children up to the age of two years of age.
      These advantages are discussed in detail in this paper. In addition, the
      appropriate and inappropriate uses of breast-milk substitutes (BMS) are
      discussed. Breast feeding also may play a role in the spread of HIV infections
      from the mother to the infant. However, in the setting of complex emergencies in 
      the developing world, the risk of an infant dying of malnutrition and infection
      when not breastfed is likely to be greater than is the risk of death due to HIV
      acquisition through breastfeeding. The physiology of lactation is reviewed with
      particular reference to the roles of prolactin, oxytocin, and the feedback
      inhibitor of lactation (FIL) hormone. No medications have been demonstrated to
      augment milk production that can be used in a practical sense in complex
      emergencies. Lastly, the principles promulgated by the WHO and UNHCR for the
      feeding of infants and children in emergencies and for milk powder distribution
      are summarized.

TI  - Epidural analgesia: effects on labor progress and maternal and neonatal outcome.
PG  - 122-35
AB  - The intended and unintended effects of epidural labor analgesia are reviewed.
      Mothers randomized to epidural rather than parenteral opioid analgesia have
      better pain relief. Fetal oxygenation is not affected by analgesic method;
      however, neonates whose mothers received intravenous or intramuscular opioids
      rather than epidural analgesia require more naloxone and have lower Apgar scores.
      Epidural analgesia does not affect the rates of cesarean delivery, obstetrically 
      indicated instrumented vaginal delivery, neonatal sepsis, or new-onset back pain.
      Epidural analgesia is associated with longer second labor stages, more frequent
      oxytocin augmentation, and maternal fever (particularly among women who shiver
      and women receiving epidural analgesia for > 5 hours) but not with longer first
      labor stages. Epidural analgesia has no affect but intrapartum opioids decrease
      lactation success. Epidural use and urinary incontinence are weakly, but probably
      not causally, associated. Epidural labor analgesia would improve if the
      mechanisms of these unintended effects could be determined.

TI  - Breast-feeding is associated with reduced perceived stress and negative mood in
      mothers.
PG  - 187-93
AB  - Two studies examined the effects of breast-feeding on maternal stress and mood.
      In Experiment 1, perceived stress in the past month was compared between 28
      breast-feeding and 27 bottle-feeding mothers. Breast-feeding mothers reported
      less perceived stress, after controlling for demographic confounds. In Experiment
      2, mood ratings were assessed in the same 24 mothers both before and then after 1
      breast-feeding and 1 bottle-feeding session. Breast-feeding was associated with a
      decrease in negative mood, and bottle-feeding was associated with a decrease in
      positive mood from pre- to postfeeding. Results indicated that breast-feeding
      buffers negative mood. These effects appeared to be attributable to the effects
      of breast-feeding itself and not solely to individual-differences factors.

TI  - [Patient satisfaction and duration of breast feeding].
PG  - 7060-3
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Only two out of three Danish women follow the recommendations for
      duration of breast-feeding given by The Danish National Board of Health, which
      recommend it as the sole source of nutrition for at least the first four months
      of life. The present study was carried out to investigate the influence of
      patient satisfaction on the duration of breast-feeding. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      Based on an earlier investigation into the satisfaction of primiparas with the
      public health service during pregnancy, delivery, and the puerperium, 145 women
      were interviewed by telephone about the period in which their child was fed
      solely by mother's milk. Mothers of twins and those who had had an elective
      caesarean or whose child had been transferred to the neonatal care unit were
      excluded. Data from the patient satisfaction study and data on the delivery
      retrieved from a local obstetric database were related to the duration of
      breast-feeding. RESULTS: The mean duration of breast-feeding only was four months
      with no association to the women's satisfaction with the public health service in
      general. There was, however, an association between the period of breast-feeding 
      only and satisfaction with issues dealing specifically with breast-feeding. In
      women who had had an oxytocin infusion breast-feeding was more often
      well-established. No other event during labour related to the initiation or
      duration of breast-feeding. There was an insignificant trend towards more use of 
      a pacifier or formula supplementation in the first days in women, who did not
      initiate breast-feeding. It is unknown whether this is a cause or a consequence. 
      DISCUSSION: The initiation of breast-feeding is influenced by the woman's
      satisfaction with the public service in matters relating to breastfeeding. In
      other ways, it is a process that is difficult to disturb.

TI  - Maternal and fetal stress are associated with impaired lactogenesis in humans.
PG  - 3012S-5S
AB  - Studies in animals indicate that various types of stressful stimuli can depress
      lactation, but there is much less information in humans. Experimental studies in 
      breastfeeding women have shown that acute physical and mental stress can impair
      the milk ejection reflex by reducing the release of oxytocin during a feed. If
      this occurs repeatedly, it could reduce milk production by preventing full
      emptying of the breast at each feed. Prospective observational studies indicate
      that both maternal and fetal stress during labor and delivery (e.g., urgent
      Cesarean sections or long duration of labor in vaginal deliveries) are associated
      with delayed onset of lactation. The effects of chronic emotional stress on
      lactation are not known. Mothers who experience high levels of stress during and 
      after childbirth should receive additional lactation guidance during the first
      week or two postpartum.

TI  - Breast stimulation for cervical ripening and induction of labour.
PG  - CD003392
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast stimulation has been suggested as an effective means of
      inducing labour. It is both an inexpensive and non-medical intervention which
      allows women greater control over the induction process. It is not clear how
      breast stimulation increases uterine contractions, however it has been shown to
      be effective for contraction stress tests and for the augmentation of labour.
      This is one of a series of reviews of methods of cervical ripening and labour
      induction using a standardised methodology. OBJECTIVES: To determine the
      effectiveness of breast stimulation for third trimester cervical ripening or
      induction of labour in comparison with placebo/no intervention or other methods
      of induction of labour. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth
      Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and bibliographies
      of relevant papers. Last searched: April 2001. SELECTION CRITERIA: (1) randomised
      controlled trials comparing breast stimulation used for third trimester cervical 
      ripening or labour induction with no intervention or other methods listed above
      it on a predefined list of labour induction methods; (2) random allocation to the
      treatment or the control group; (3) adequate allocation concealment; (4)
      violations of allocated management not sufficient to materially affect
      conclusions; (5) clinically meaning outcome measures reported; (6) data available
      for analysis according to the random allocation; (7) missing data insufficient to
      materially affect the conclusions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A generic
      strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial
      data relating to labour induction. This involved a two-stage method of data
      extraction. The initial data extraction was done centrally. MAIN RESULTS: Six
      randomised controlled trials were included in the analysis involving 719 women.
      When trials comparing breast stimulation with no intervention were analysed there
      was a significant reduction in the number of women not in labour at 72 hours
      (62.7% versus 93.6%, relative risk (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 -
      0.74). However, this result did not remain significant in women with an
      unfavourable cervix. There were no instances of uterine hyperstimulation. A
      reduction in the rate of postpartum haemorrhage was reported (0.7% versus 6%, RR 
      0.16, 95% CI 0.03 - 0.87). No significant difference was detected in the
      caesarean section rate (9% versus 10%, relative risk RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.38 - 2.12)
      or rates of meconium staining. Three perinatal deaths were reported (1.8% versus 
      0%, RR 8.17, 95% CI 0.45 - 147.77). This finding should be interpreted with
      caution. The three deaths occurred in the breast stimulation arm of a three-armed
      trial (breast stimulation versus no intervention versus oxytocin) of questionable
      quality. The study was very small (n = 57), involved only high risk women, and
      the method of randomisation was not reported. When comparing breast stimulation
      with oxytocin alone the analysis found no difference in caesarean section rates
      (28% versus 47%, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 - 1.18). No difference was detected in the 
      number of women not in labour after 72 hours (58.8% versus 25%, RR 2.35, 95% CI
      1.00 - 5.54). There was no significant difference in the rates of meconium
      staining. There were four perinatal deaths. Three in the breast stimulation arm, 
      and one in the oxytocin arm of the three-armed trial noted above (17.6% versus
      5%, RR 3.53, 95% CI 0.40-30.88). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Breast stimulation
      cannot be fully evaluated on efficacy and safety grounds from the included
      studies. Whilst it would appear beneficial in terms of a reduction in the number 
      of women not in labour after 72 hours, and a reduction in postpartum haemorrhage,
      until safety issues have been fully evaluated it should not be considered for use
      in a high risk population.

TI  - Effects of suckling on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to
      psychosocial stress in postpartum lactating women.
PG  - 4798-804
AB  - In several studies lactation has been shown to be associated with a
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyporesponsiveness to physical and
      psychological stressors. As it is not known whether the marked blunting of
      endocrine stress reactivity in women can be ascribed to suckling as a short-term 
      effect or to lactation in general, the acute effects of suckling on the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system 
      responses to mental stress were investigated in lactating women. Forty-three
      lactating women were randomly assigned either to breast-feed or to hold their
      infants for a 15-min period with the onset 30 min before they were exposed to a
      brief psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test). Both breast-feeding and
      holding the infant yielded significant decreases in ACTH, total plasma cortisol, 
      and salivary free cortisol (all P < 0.01). There were no significant differences 
      in baseline hormone levels between the groups 1 min before the stress test. In
      response to stress exposure, ACTH, total plasma cortisol, salivary free cortisol,
      norepinephrine, and epinephrine were significantly increased in all lactating
      women (all P < 0.001). However, total cortisol and free cortisol responses to
      stress were attenuated in breast-feeding women (P = 0.001 and P = 0.067,
      respectively), who also showed significantly decreasing PRL levels during the
      stress test (P = 0.005). In addition, there was no change in plasma oxytocin or
      vasopressin in response to the stressor. Breast-feeding as well as holding led to
      decreased anxiety (P < 0.05), whereas, in contrast, stress exposure worsened
      mood, calmness, and anxiety in the total group (all P < 0.001). From these data
      we conclude that lactation in women, in contrast to that in rats, does not result
      in a general restraint of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to a
      psychosocial stressor. Rather, suckling is suggested to exert a short-term
      suppression of the cortisol response to mental stress.

TI  - Estrogen response elements alter coactivator recruitment through allosteric
      modulation of estrogen receptor beta conformation.
PG  - 45282-8
AB  - Estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) activates transcription by binding to estrogen
      response elements (EREs) and coactivator proteins that act as bridging proteins
      between the receptor and the basal transcription machinery. Although the
      imperfect vitellogenin B1, pS2, and oxytocin (OT) EREs each differ from the
      consensus vitellogenin A2 ERE sequence by a single base pair, ERbeta activates
      transcription of reporter plasmids containing A2, pS2, B1, and OT EREs to
      different extents. To explain how these differences in transactivation might
      occur, we have examined the interaction of ERbeta with these EREs and monitored
      recruitment of the coactivators amplified in breast cancer (AIB1) and
      transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2). Protease sensitivity, antibody
      interaction, and DNA pull-down assays demonstrated that ERbeta undergoes
      ERE-dependent changes in conformation resulting in differential recruitment of
      AIB1 and TIF2 to the DNA-bound receptor. Overexpression of TIF2 or AIB1 in
      transient transfection assays differentially enhanced ERbeta-mediated
      transcription of reporter plasmids containing the A2, pS2, B1, and OT EREs. Our
      studies demonstrate that individual ERE sequences induce changes in conformation 
      of the DNA-bound receptor and influence coactivator recruitment. DNA-induced
      modulation of receptor conformation may contribute to the ability of ERbeta to
      differentially activate transcription of genes containing divergent ERE
      sequences.

TI  - Sympathetic innervation of mammary glands mediates suckling-induced reflex
      inhibition of milk yield in rats.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - Previous work has shown that physiologic activation of the sympathetic system may
      inhibit milk yield (ME) in rats. Thus, adrenal catecholamines (CAs) are released 
      by suckling, but it is not known whether such inhibition results also from reflex
      activation by the same stimulus of neural sympathetics upon the mammary gland.
      The present experiments were designed to determine whether suckling inhibits ME
      induced by oxytocin (OT) in the urethane-anesthetized lactating rat, and whether 
      such inhibition results from adrenal and/or neurally released CAs. Rats were
      isolated (6 h) from their pups and then anesthetized. OT (0.8 mU every 2 min) was
      administered intravenously to the mothers during suckling. Rats were either
      chronically implanted with cannulae into the lateral cerebral ventricles
      (intracerebroventricularly), bilaterally adrenalectomized (ADX),
      hypophysectomized (HX), spinal cord transected (SCT: T3-T4), or had the nipple
      area (NA) locally anesthetized before suckling. MEs were low in control, sham,
      ADX and HX rats, but not in rats given the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol
      (PROP; intravenously or intracerebroventricularly injected), nor in SCT, NA or
      PROP-HX rats. As revealed by ductal resistance measurements as an indicator of
      ductal tone, suckling-induced inhibition of ME was due to ductal constriction
      within the mammary glands. These effects of suckling, however, could be prevented
      by prior activation of ductal mechanoreceptors. Together, these results indicate 
      that suckling inhibits ME through the reflex activation of neurally mediated
      central beta-adrenergic mechanisms, and that these effects, in turn, can be
      regulated by ductal mechanoreceptor activation.

TI  - Allosteric modulation of estrogen receptor conformation by different estrogen
      response elements.
PG  - 1114-26
AB  - Estrogen-regulated gene expression is dependent on interaction of the estrogen
      receptor (ER) with the estrogen response element (ERE). We assessed the ability
      of the ER to activate transcription of reporter plasmids containing either the
      consensus vitellogenin A2 ERE or the imperfect pS2, vitellogenin B1, or oxytocin 
      (OT) ERE. The A2 ERE was the most potent activator of transcription. The OT ERE
      was significantly more effective in activating transcription than either the pS2 
      or B1 ERE. In deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) footprinting experiments, MCF-7
      proteins protected A2 and OT EREs more effectively than the pS2 and B1 EREs.
      Limited protease digestion of the A2, pS2, B1, or OT ERE-bound receptor with V8
      protease or proteinase K produced distinct cleavage products demonstrating that
      individual ERE sequences induce specific changes in ER conformation. Receptor
      interaction domains of glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 and steroid 
      receptor coactivator 1 bound effectively to the A2, pS2, B1, and OT ERE-bound
      receptor and significantly stabilized the receptor-DNA interaction. Similar
      levels of the full-length p160 protein amplified in breast cancer 1 were
      recruited from HeLa nuclear extracts by the A2, pS2, B1, and OT ERE-bound
      receptors. In contrast, significantly less transcriptional intermediary factor 2 
      was recruited by the B1 ERE-bound receptor than by the A2 ERE-bound receptor.
      These studies suggest that allosteric modulation of ER conformation by individual
      ERE sequences influences the recruitment of specific coactivator proteins and
      leads to differential expression of genes containing divergent ERE sequences.

TI  - Treatments for breast engorgement during lactation.
PG  - CD000046
AB  - BACKGROUND: National surveys have shown that painful breasts are the second most 
      common reason for giving up breastfeeding in the first two weeks after birth in
      the UK. One factor contributing to such pain can be breast engorgement. Views
      differ as to how engorgement arises, although restrictive feeding patterns in
      hospital are likely to have contributed in the past. These differing views are
      reflected in the range of solutions offered to treat engorgement in breastfeeding
      mothers and these treatments are assessed in this review. OBJECTIVES: To
      determine the effects of any proposed intervention to relieve symptoms of breast 
      engorgement among breastfeeding women. SEARCH STRATEGY: The register of clinical 
      trials maintained and updated by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.
      CINAHL and MEDLINE were also searched. Date of last search: December 2000.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and 'quasi-randomised' controlled trials, with
      or without blinding, that assess the effectiveness of treatments for the
      alleviation of symptoms in breastfeeding women experiencing engorgement. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a
      second reviewer. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials, involving 424 women, were included. 
      Three different studies were identified which used cabbage leaves or cabbage leaf
      extracts;. no overall benefit was found. Ultrasound treatment and placebo were
      equally effective. Use of Danzen (an anti-inflammatory agent) significantly
      improved the total symptoms of engorgement when compared to placebo (odds ratio
      (OR) 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 - 10.3) as did bromelain/trypsin
      complex (OR 8.02, 95% CI 2.8-23.3). Oxytocin and cold packs had no demonstrable
      effect on engorgement symptoms. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Cabbage leaves and gel
      packs were equally effective in the treatment of engorgement. Since both cabbage 
      extract and placebo cream were equally effective, the alleviation in symptoms may
      be brought about by other factors, such as breast massage. Ultrasound treatment
      is equally effective with or without the ultra-wave emitting crystal, therefore
      its effectiveness is more likely to be due to the effect of radiant heat or
      massage. Pharmacologically, oxytocin was not an effective engorgement treatment
      while Danzen and bromelain/trypsin complex significantly improved the symptoms of
      engorgement. Initial prevention of breast engorgement should remain the key
      priority.

TI  - Maternal smoking and reduced duration of breastfeeding: a review of possible
      mechanisms.
PG  - 45-67
AB  - AIM: To systematically review the possible mechanisms by which maternal smoking
      affects lactation. METHODS: Databases (Medline, CINAHL, Current Contents,
      Psychinfo, Sociological Abstracts and the Cochrane Library) were searched for
      smoking and breastfeeding or infant feeding. The Journal of Human Lactation and
      Birth were hand-searched, searches were also conducted at NMAA's Lactation
      Resource Centre and references cited were located where appropriate. Articles
      were divided into the various ways that smoking could affect breastfeeding and
      were tabulated. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted on small samples of animals 
      or humans; the majority were prior to 1985. Most animal studies exposed the
      animals to much greater levels of nicotine than those to which humans are
      exposed. Most studies did not examine if breastfeeding behaviour was similar in
      smokers and non-smokers, and did not consider that any physiological difference
      found could be the result of poor lactation practices, rather than the cause of
      poor lactation in smokers. The definition of breastfeeding infants was also
      problematic in many studies. The effect of smoking on oxytocin in women was only 
      examined in one study, and no effect was found, yet a negative effect of smoking 
      on oxytocin release is reported in the breastfeeding literature. CONCLUSION:
      Although there is consistent evidence that women who smoke breastfeed their
      infants for a shorter duration than non-smokers, the evidence for a physiological
      mechanism is not strong.

      acid-lys(8)-vasotocin: a new powerful radioligand for oxytocin
      receptor-expressing tumors.
PG  - 4393-7
AB  - We developed a radioactive ligand for tumors expressing oxytocin receptors (OTRs)
      by linking the chelating agent
      1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N",N"'-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) to
      Lys(8)-vasotocin (LVT), an analogue of oxytocin with high affinity for OTRs. The 
      new reagent (DOTA-LVT) retained high affinity for human OTRs, as proved by in
      vitro affinity binding to cells endogenously expressing OTRs, such as MCF7 breast
      carcinoma and MOG-U-V-W glioblastoma cells lines, as well as to transiently
      transfected COS7 cells. In in vivo experiments, DOTA-LVT carrying (111)In showed 
      specific binding activity to OTR-positive TS/A mouse mammary tumors. The present 
      study opens new perspectives for imaging and, possibly, therapy of OTR-positive
      human tumors such as breast and endometrial carcinomas, neuroblastomas, and
      glioblastomas.

PG  - 205-9
AB  - Steroids and related compounds are important in disease development and
      prevention, via steroid receptor-mediated and receptor-independent mechanisms.
      Interaction of endogenous oestrogens with the oestrogen receptor has unfortunate 
      mitogenic effects in breast cancer. However, dietary consumption of non-steroidal
      weak oestrogens, such as the soy isoflavone phytoestrogens genistein and
      diadzein, is associated with a decreased breast cancer risk. This may arise in
      part from the suboptimal configuration induced in the transactivation helix of
      oestrogen receptor-beta.

TI  - Gene expression and amplification in breast carcinoma cells with intrinsic and
      acquired doxorubicin resistance.
PG  - 1300-6
AB  - The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is a major cause of cancer treatment
      failure. Here the expressions of 4224 genes were analysed for association with
      intrinsic or acquired doxorubicin (DOX) resistance. A cluster of overexpressed
      genes related to DOX resistance was observed. Included in this cluster was ABCB1 
      the P-glycoprotein transporter protein gene and MMP1 (Matrix Metalloproteinase
      1), indicative of the invasive nature of resistant cells, and the oxytocin
      receptor (OXTR), a potential new therapeutic target. Overexpression of genes
      associated with xenobiotic transformation, cell transformation, cell signalling
      and lymphocyte activation was also associated with DOX resistance as was estrogen
      receptor negativity. In all carcinoma cells, compared with HBL100 a putatively
      normal breast epithelial cell line, a cluster of overexpressed genes was
      identified which included several keratins, in particular keratins 8 and 18 which
      are regulated through the ras signalling pathway. Analysis of genomic
      amplifications and deletions revealed specific genetic alterations common to both
      intrinsic and acquired DOX resistance including ABCB1, PGY3 (ABCB4) and BAK. The 
      findings shown here indicate new possibilities for the diagnosis of DOX
      resistance using gene expression, and potential novel therapeutic targets for
      pharmacological intervention.

TI  - Postpartum maternal oxytocin release by newborns: effects of infant hand massage 
      and sucking.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Newborns placed skin-to-skin with their mothers show an inborn
      sequence of behavior similar to that seen in other mammals. The purpose of this
      study was to make a detailed exploration of hand movements and sucking behavior
      in healthy term newborns who were placed skin-to-skin on their mothers' chests,
      and to study maternal oxytocin release in relation to these behaviors. METHODS:
      Ten vaginally delivered infants whose mothers had not been exposed to maternal
      analgesia were video-recorded from birth until the first breastfeeding. Video
      protocols were developed based on observations of the videotapes. Each infant's
      hand, finger, mouth, and tongue movements, positions of the hand and body, and
      sucking behavior were assessed every 30 seconds. Maternal blood samples were
      collected every 15 minutes, and oxytocin levels were analyzed by
      radioimmunoassay. A statistical test for establishing the relationship between
      maternal oxytocin levels and infants' hand movements or sucking behavior was
      developed. RESULTS: Infants used their hands to explore and stimulate their
      mother's breast in preparation for the first breastfeeding. A coordinated pattern
      of infant hand and sucking movements was also identified. When the infants were
      sucking, the massagelike hand movements stopped and started again when the
      infants made a sucking pause. Periods of increased massagelike hand movements or 
      sucking of the mother's breast were followed by an increase in maternal oxytocin 
      levels (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the newborns use
      their hands as well as their mouths to stimulate maternal oxytocin release after 
      birth, which may have significance for uterine contraction, milk ejection, and
      mother-infant interaction.

PG  - 581-3
AB  - A case of a successful induction of lactation in a commissioning mother of a
      surrogate pregnancy is reported. Induction of lactation was achieved with oral
      metoclopramide which was well tolerated. Alternative methods to induce lactation 
      are reviewed. The advantages of breast-feeding and the relative ease with which
      lactation can be induced after a surrogate pregnancy would suggest that this
      could be offered to all commissioning mothers.

TI  - Serum prolactin in breastfeeding: state of the science.
PG  - 65-75
AB  - Prolactin is one of two major hormones involved in lactation. While the role of
      infant suckling and oxytocin in the lactation process are well understood, the
      role of prolactin is less clear. A variety of factors related to prolactin have
      been investigated, and these are used as an organizing framework for this
      article. Factors include pregnancy, lactation, nursing frequency, prior lactation
      experience, milk production, and pharmacologic agents. The literature, while
      substantial in amount, presents inconsistencies. Implications for practice are
      discussed.

TI  - Oxytocin responsivity in mothers of infants: a preliminary study of relationships
      with blood pressure during laboratory stress and normal ambulatory activity.
PG  - 560-7
AB  - The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) enhances maternal behavior and decreases blood
      pressure (BP) and stress responses in animals. Thus, the relationship of OT
      responsivity to BP in 14 breast- and 11 bottle-feeding mothers of infants was
      examined. Laboratory BP was assessed during baseline, speech preparation, active 
      speech, and recovery on 2 days, 1 in which baseline and speech were separated by 
      10 min of baby holding and the other by no baby contact. Systolic BP reactivity
      to speech was lower after baby contact. Plasma OT change from baseline to speech 
      after baby contact defined OT increase, minimal OT change, and OT decrease
      groups. OT increase mothers were primarily breast-feeders, and they had lower BP 
      throughout both stress sessions and after baby feeding at home than OT decrease
      mothers, who also had greater BP reactivity to preparation and recovery. These
      results suggest that oxytocin has antistress and BP-lowering effects in humans.

TI  - PAF produced by human breast cancer cells promotes migration and proliferation of
      tumor cells and neo-angiogenesis.
PG  - 1713-25
AB  - Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a phospholipid mediator of inflammation, is
      present in breast cancer tissue and correlates with microvessel density. In the
      present study, we investigated the biological significance of PAF synthesized
      within breast cancer. In vitro, we observed the production of PAF by two
      estrogen-dependent (MCF7 and T-47D) and an estrogen-independent (MDA-MB231)
      breast cancer cell lines after stimulation with vascular endothelial growth
      factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, tumor necrosis 
      factor, thrombin but not with estrogen, progesterone, and oxytocin. The
      sensitivity to agonist stimulation and the amount of PAF synthesized as
      cell-associated or released varied in different cell lines, being higher in
      MDA-MB231 cells, which are known to be highly invasive. We further demonstrate,
      by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and cytofluorimetry, that all 
      of the breast cancer cells express the PAF receptor and respond to PAF
      stimulation in terms of proliferation. Moreover, in MDA-MB231 cells PAF elicited 
      cell motility. In vivo, two structurally different PAF receptor antagonists WEB
      2170 and CV 3988 significantly reduced the formation of new vessels in a tumor
      induced by subcutaneous implantation of MDA-MB231 cells into SCID mice. In
      conclusion, these results suggest that PAF, produced and released by breast
      cancer cells, can contribute to tumor development by enhancing cell motility and 
      proliferation and by stimulating the angiogenic response.

TI  - Relation of plasma oxytocin and prolactin concentrations to milk production in
      mothers of preterm infants: influence of stress.
PG  - 3661-8
AB  - Responses of oxytocin and PRL to mechanical breast pumping and the influence of
      physiological indicators of stress were measured at 2, 4, and 6 weeks postpartum 
      to determine potential causes of inadequate milk production in 18 women with
      prematurely delivered, nonnursing (<1500 g) infants. Median milk production was
      similar to that reported in breastfeeding mothers, but a third of mothers were
      producing less than half as much by week 6. Plasma oxytocin was similar to that
      previously reported for breastfeeding mothers. The oxytocin area under the curve 
      (AUC) for breast-pumping sessions (70 min) was correlated at each occasion (r =
      0.37, 0.58, and 0.55, respectively) with milk yield. Unlike reports of PRL levels
      in breast-feeding women, PRL AUC declined between weeks 2 and 6 weeks postpartum 
      (P = 0.03); significant increases in plasma PRL occurred in response to pumping
      at 2 and 4 weeks, but not at 6 weeks. Salivary amylase, a measure of
      alpha-adrenergic activity, was highly negatively correlated on each occasion with
      PRL AUC (r = -0.58, -0.68, and -0.86, respectively), but not with oxytocin.
      Salivary cortisol was negatively correlated to a lesser degree. We hypothesize
      that deficiencies in preterm lactation are mediated in part upon stress-induced
      suppression of PRL secretion through an adrenergic mechanism.

TI  - [Physiology of secretory cells in the mouse mammary gland].
PG  - 1057-65
AB  - Secretory cells' membrane potential and transepithelial potential difference in
      the mouse mammary gland diminish within 2.5 hours following breast-feeding of the
      litter. The transepithelial resistance for up to 20 hours after the feeding did
      not drop below 40-70 k omega. The secret pressure in the mammary gland does not
      grow during this period. Therefore an increase of interval between litter feeding
      up to 20 hours does not entail any mechanical lesion of the secretory epithelium.
      The latter's cells seem to secrete organic and inorganic substances in
      concentrations which do not change significantly during their transfer along the 
      outgoing ducts.

TI  - Hormonal regulation of radioiodide uptake activity and Na+/I- symporter
      expression in mammary glands.
PG  - 2936-43
AB  - The observation that radioiodide uptake (RAIU) activity, mediated by the Na+/I-
      symporter (NIS), is significantly increased in lactating breast suggests that
      RAIU and NIS expression in mammary gland are modulated by hormones involved in
      active lactation. We showed that both the NIS expression level and RAIU in rat
      mammary gland are maximal during active lactation compared to those in the
      mammary glands of virgin and pregnant rats as well as the involuting mammary
      gland. In the lactating mammary gland, NIS is clustered on the basolateral
      membrane of alveolar cells as a lesser glycosylated form than NIS in thyroid. The
      RAIU of lactating mammary gland was partially inhibited by treatment with a
      selective oxytocin antagonist or bromocriptine, an inhibitor of PRL release.
      These findings suggest that RAIU and NIS expression in mammary gland are at least
      in part modulated by oxytocin and PRL. Indeed, we showed that NIS messenger
      ribonucleic acid level was increased in a dose-dependent manner by oxytocin and
      PRL in histocultured human breast tumors.

TI  - Retinoic acid induces sodium/iodide symporter gene expression and radioiodide
      uptake in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.
PG  - 8519-24
AB  - The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) stimulates iodide uptake in normal lactating
      breast, but is not known to be active in nonlactating breast or breast cancer. We
      studied NIS gene regulation and iodide uptake in MCF-7 cells, an estrogen
      receptor (ER)-positive human breast cancer cell line. All-trans retinoic acid
      (tRA) treatment stimulated iodide uptake in a time- and dose-dependent fashion up
      to approximately 9.4-fold above baseline. Stimulation with selective retinoid
      compounds indicated that the induction of iodide uptake was mediated by retinoic 
      acid receptor. Treatment with tRA markedly stimulated NIS mRNA and immunoreactive
      protein ( approximately 68 kDa). tRA stimulated NIS gene transcription
      approximately 4-fold, as shown by nuclear run-on assay. No induction of iodide
      uptake was observed with RA treatment of an ER-negative human breast cancer cell 
      line, MDA-MB 231, or a normal human breast cell line, MCF-12A. The iodide efflux 
      rate of tRA-treated MCF-7 cells was slow (t(1/2) = 24 min), compared with that in
      FRTL-5 thyroid cells (t(1/2) = 3.9 min), favoring iodide retention in MCF-7
      cells. An in vitro clonogenic assay demonstrated selective cytotoxicity with
      (131)I after tRA stimulation of MCF-7 cells. tRA up-regulates NIS gene expression
      and iodide uptake in an ER-positive breast cancer cell line. Stimulation of
      radioiodide uptake after systemic retinoid treatment may be useful for diagnosis 
      and treatment of some differentiated breast cancers.

AB  - Histological studies revealed that the mammary gland nipple have smooth muscle
      fibres along the nipple channel. These fibres infiltrate the connective tissue
      parallel to the skin. The ring muscles are not obvious. Delays in the milk
      excretion in mice may be due to specifics of allocation and functioning of the
      nipple smooth muscles. To obtain milk, a mechanical action upon the nipple and a 
      synchronised release of oxitocin into the blood are necessary.

TI  - Oxytocin for promoting successful lactation.
PG  - CD000156
AB  - BACKGROUND: A rise in the concentration of oxytocin causes contraction of cells
      around the alveoli and milk ducts, in preparation for suckling. Lactation failure
      may result from insufficient oxytocin. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review
      was to assess the effects of using oral or nasal oxytocin on lactation. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials
      register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of variable 
      doses of oxytocin and different methods of administration versus placebo in
      breastfeeding women using oxytocin to augment lactation. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted by two reviewers.
      MAIN RESULTS: Four trials of 639 women were included. There was potential for
      significant bias in these trials. Restricted breastfeeding schedules may have
      contributed to inadequate production of milk by the participants. Sublingual and 
      buccal preparations of oxytocin were associated with an increase in milk
      production. Oxytocin did not appear to increase the incidence of breast pain and 
      100 international units of oxytocin appeared to be slightly more beneficial than 
      10 international units. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: An appropriate dose of sublingual
      or buccal oxytocin may help augment lactation where necessary. However if women
      are encouraged and supported with unrestricted breastfeeding, the need for
      oxytocin would probably be diminished.

TI  - Steroidal influences on oxytocin neurones.
PG  - 315
AB  - Oxytocin is essential for successful lactation. Without it, a babe that sucks at 
      a nipple will go hungry, even if the breast at which it sucks is engorged with
      milk. In lactating rats, oxytocin cells respond to suckling with brief,
      explosive, synchronous bursts of electrical activity (Lincoln & Wakerley, 1974). 
      This behaviour is not observed in virgin rats even in response to stimuli that
      strongly excite oxytocin cells, and is not even observed in lactating rats in
      response to any stimulus other than suckling.

TI  - Oxytocin receptors in human adenocarcinomas of the endometrium: presence and
      biological significance.
PG  - 470-7
AB  - Oxytocin receptors (OTRs) are expressed in endometrial cells and oxytocin (OT)
      participates in endometrial functions. In cancers derived from other OT target
      tissues, such as breast and neural tissues, the expression of OTRs and the
      antiproliferative effect of OT on cancer cells has been previously observed. This
      study was therefore designed to search for OTR expression and the OT effect in
      endometrial carcinomas. To demonstrate the presence and the location of OTRs and 
      OTR mRNA immunocytochemical, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) procedures were employed in a series of 
      human adenocarcinomas of the endometrium. Using an anti-OTR monoclonal antibody
      (IF3), OTRs were demonstrated in the large majority of endometrial carcinomas
      (82%), with a pattern of positivity varying from diffuse to focal, according to
      tumour differentiation. The OTR gene was demonstrated in 78% of the cases by
      RT-PCR and its presence was confirmed in selected cases by ISH. Moreover, in a
      human endometrial carcinoma cell line (COLO 684) OTR was demonstrated by
      immunofluorescence and RT-PCR and it was observed that OT treatment
      (10(-11)-10(-7) M) significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Neither toxic
      effects nor apoptosis were induced by OT treatment. The addition of an inhibitor 
      of protein kinase A (PKA) to the culture medium abolished the antiproliferative
      effect of OT, suggesting that cAMP via PKA could be the intracellular mediator of
      the OT effect, as previously observed in breast and neural tumours. In
      conclusion, this study presents evidence of OTR expression in human endometrial
      carcinomas and of an OT antiproliferative effect on human endometrial cancer
      cells in vitro. It is further suggested that OT and OTR may be involved in the
      regulation of endometrial cells, not only in physiological conditions but also in
      a neoplastic context.

TI  - A comparison of breast stimulation and intravenous oxytocin for the augmentation 
      of labor.
PG  - 115-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast stimulation to augment labor has been used for centuries in
      tribal societies and by midwives. In recent years it has been shown to be
      effective in ripening the cervix, inducing labor, and as an alternative to
      oxytocin for the contraction stress test. This study compared the effectiveness
      of breast stimulation with oxytocin infusion in augmenting labor. METHODS: Women 
      admitted to the labor ward were eligible for the study if they had inadequate
      labor with premature rupture of the membranes and met inclusion criteria. They
      were assigned to oxytocin augmentation or breast stimulation (manual or pump),
      and were switched to oxytocin in the event of method failure. Outcomes included
      time to delivery, intervention to delivery, proportion of spontaneous deliveries,
      and Apgar scores. One hundred participants were needed in each arm of the study
      to demonstrate a 2- to 3-hour difference in delivery time, with a power of 80
      percent. RESULTS: Analysis was performed on 79 women, of whom 49 were in the
      breast stimulation group and 30 in the oxytocin group. Sixty-five percent of the 
      participants failed breast stimulation and were switched to oxytocin infusion.
      Although augmentation start to delivery was shorter for the oxytocin group (p <
      0.001), no differences in total labor time occurred between the groups.
      Nulliparas receiving breast stimulation had more spontaneous (relative risk 1.7, 
      p = 0.04), and fewer instrumental deliveries than those receiving oxytocin
      (relative risk 0.2, p = 0.02). No significant differences in adverse fetal
      outcomes occurred between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: The small number of
      participants and a variety of problems with the conduct of the study prevented
      the formulation of reliable conclusions from the results. However, the study
      provided important insights into the feasibility and problems of developing a
      high-quality randomized trial of augmentation by breast stimulation.

TI  - The obstetrical and postpartum benefits of continuous support during childbirth.
PG  - 1257-64
AB  - The purpose of this article is to review the evidence regarding the effectiveness
      of continuous support provided by a trained laywoman (doula) during childbirth on
      obstetrical and postpartum outcomes. Twelve individual randomized trials have
      compared obstetrical and postpartum outcomes between doula-supported women and
      women who did not receive doula support during childbirth. Three meta-analyses,
      which used different approaches, have been performed on the results of the
      clinical trials. Emotional and physical support significantly shortens labor and 
      decreases the need for cesarean deliveries, forceps and vacuum extraction,
      oxytocin augmentation, and analgesia. Doula-supported mothers also rate
      childbirth as less difficult and painful than do women not supported by a doula. 
      Labor support by fathers does not appear to produce similar obstetrical benefits.
      Eight of the 12 trials report early or late psychosocial benefits of doula
      support. Early benefits include reductions in state anxiety scores, positive
      feelings about the birth experience, and increased rates of breastfeeding
      initiation. Later postpartum benefits include decreased symptoms of depression,
      improved self-esteem, exclusive breastfeeding, and increased sensitivity of the
      mother to her child's needs. The results of these 12 trials strongly suggest that
      doula support is an essential component of childbirth. A thorough reorganization 
      of current birth practices is in order to ensure that every woman has access to
      continuous emotional and physical support during labor.

TI  - Ethanol Consumption by Lactating Rats Induces Changes in Pup's Fatty Acid
      Profiles.
PG  - 331-7
LID - 10.1080/1028415X.2000.11747330 [doi]
AB  - From parturition, lactating Wistar rats were given 20% ethanol in drinking water 
      and solid diet ad libitum (ET group) or were pair-fed to the ET group (PF group) 
      or were given water and solid diet ad libitum (control group, C). Animals were
      studied on day 12 of lactation and/or treatment, when dams were separated from
      their litters and 2-4 hours latter they were i.p. injected with oxytocin for milk
      collection under anaesthesia. Maternal food intake, weight gain and pup's body
      weight were lower in ET than in C rats. When compared to C rats, milk of ET dams 
      had a decreased proportion of C14:0 and C22:6 n-3 fatty acids while an increase
      in C18:0,C16:1 and C18:1 n-9 was detected, whereas when compared to PF it had
      higher C8:0,C10:0,C18:0,C18:1 n-9, C18:2 n-6 and lower C20:5 n-3 and C22:6 n-3.
      Body weight was lower in pups from ET than in those from C or PF, and whereas
      brain weight and brain lipid content was lower in ET and PF pupsthan in C, total 
      phospholipid (PL) brain content was similar among the groups. The ratio of C20:3 
      n-9 to C20:4 n-6 in brain PL was higher in ET pups than in either C or PF,
      indicating an essential fatty acid deficiency in the formers. Ethanol treatment
      also decreased the proportional amount of C18:2 n-6, C18:3 n-3, C20:4 n-6, C20:5 
      n-3 and C22:6 n-3 in brain PL as compared to C, whereas from these fatty acids
      only C18:3 n-3, C20:5 n-3 and C22:6 n-3 were decreased in PF. On the other hand, 
      the proportion of C22:6 n-3 was significantly lower in the pups of ET group than 
      in PF animals. Present results show that maternal intake of ethanol during
      lactation in the rat modifies milk lipid composition and that these effects are
      not caused by the undernutrition condition of the animals. These effects alter
      fatty acid composition of brain PL in pups, and such effect may contribute to its
      abnormal development.

TI  - Selective expression of neuropeptides in the rat mammary gland: somatostatin gene
      is expressed during lactation.
PG  - 5915-21
AB  - The existence of numerous neuropeptides in milk, in concentrations that exceed
      those in maternal plasma, is well established. It is still unclear whether these 
      neuropeptides are produced by the mammary gland or that the gland concentrates
      them from the general circulation. In this study, we have examined the
      possibility that the genes of these neuropeptides are expressed in the rat
      mammary gland. RNA was extracted from the mammary glands of female rats during
      different stages of reproduction as well as from other tissues such as
      hypothalami, pancreas, pineal glands, small intestine, and ovaries. Following RT 
      reaction, the resulting cDNA were amplified by radioactive PCR using specific
      oligonucleotide primers. We have used specific primers for the following
      neuropeptides: galanin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, TRH,
      GH-releasing hormone, cholecystokinin, neurotensin, oxytocin, and relaxin. We
      have also used primers for serotonin N-acetyl-transferase, the enzyme that is
      involved in melatonin biosynthesis. The ribosomal protein S-16 served as an
      internal control. Among all the neuropeptides that have been examined,
      somatostatin was the only one that was found to be expressed in the mammary
      gland. Somatostatin was expressed in the mammary gland of lactating rats, but not
      of virgin rats. Expression of the somatostatin gene was confirmed by Southern
      blot analysis and by sequencing of the PCR products. Immunohistochemical studies 
      demonstrated somatostatin immunoreactivity in the epithelial cells that compose
      the secretory alveoli and in the secretory material. In addition, we have found
      that the mammary glands of the lactating rat express the PC-1 proteinase gene
      that process prosomatostatin to generate somatostatin-14, but do not express
      furin, the enzyme that is responsible for somatostatin-28 production. This
      finding substantiates previous studies that demonstrated that only
      somatostatin-14 is present in milk. The finding that most of the neuropeptides,
      examined by RT-PCR, are not expressed by the mammary gland suggest that these
      neuropeptides are actively concentrated by the mammary glands from the general
      circulation. The GnRH gene has been previously demonstrated to be expressed in
      the mammary gland, and in this study somatostatin was the only neuropeptide that 
      was found to be produced by the mammary gland. The observation that only a small 
      portion of the neuropeptides that are present in milk are being produced by the
      lactating mammary gland suggest that these neuropeptides have important functions
      in the biology of the suckling neonate and probably also in the development and
      function of the breast.

      who initiated the use of bilateral pumping, metoclopramide, syntocinon nasal
      spray, and a supplemental nursing system to induce lactation. Lactogenesis was
      initiated within 10 days of the adoption. No measurable milk was pumped until the
      baby was 4 months old at which time the mother began pumping 4 ounces per breast 
      within 1 week. The mother stopped pumping, taking metoclopramide (Regian) and
      syntocinon, and using the supplementer system at this time. She continued to
      breastfeed without the use of bottles throughout the fourth and fifth months with
      the baby maintaining adequate weight gain.

TI  - Oxytocin does not induce a rise in intracellular free calcium in human breast
      cancer cells.
PG  - 115-28
AB  - Research suggests that oxytocin acts as a growth modulating agent for breast
      cancer cells. However, the signaling mechanisms responsible for these modulatory 
      effects have not been fully elucidated. In the physiological setting oxytocin is 
      known to stimulate contraction of myometrial cells in the uterus and
      myoepithelial cells in the breast by increasing intracellular free calcium
      ([Ca2+]i). The expression of oxytocin receptor mRNA in T-47D breast cancer cells,
      and four additional breast cancer cell lines (BT-549, MCF-7, MDA-MB- 231,
      ZR-75-1), was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Oxytocin-induced changes in [Ca2+]i
      in indo-1 AM loaded T-47D breast cancer cells were monitored using flow
      cytometric analysis. In this cell line, oxytocin (0, 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 nM)
      did not induce a dose-dependent increase in the mean 405 nm/485 nm emission
      ratio. These results indicate that oxytocin signaling in T-47D breast cancer
      cells does not appear to involve an increase in [Ca2+]i.

TI  - Morphine suppresses the oxytocin response in breast-feeding women.
PG  - 33-7
AB  - The activity of opiate-mediated regulatory mechanisms of oxytocin secretion
      during breast-feeding was studied by the administration of either morphine,
      naloxone or placebo to women prior to the commencement of breast-feeding.
      Seventeen healthy women in the first week after delivery who had established
      lactation were randomized to receive either intravenous morphine 5 mg (n = 6),
      naloxone 2.4 mg (n = 6) or a placebo, sterile water (n = 5), which was given
      prior to commencement of breast-feeding. Oxytocin levels were measured by
      radioimmunoassay prior to initiation of breast-feeding and then at 2-min
      intervals until the feed was complete. Breast-feeding produced a significant rise
      in oxytocin levels in the control and naloxone groups but no significant rise in 
      the patients given morphine. There was a significant reduction in oxytocin
      response following morphine administration when compared to placebo but not
      between naloxone and placebo. In conclusion, oxytocin secretion to breast-feeding
      is inhibited by exogenous morphine when compared to a control group but the
      administration of naloxone did not produce a significant difference from control.

TI  - The biology of breast cancer.
PG  - 311-32
AB  - This article focuses on the major hormones and growth factors for which a
      critical role in normal mammary growth has been clearly defined. Certainly other 
      hormonal systems and growth factors could also affect breast cancer initiation
      and progression, but their exact contribution to normal and/or malignant breast
      cell growth is poorly delineated. Examples of such factors include somatostatin, 
      mammostatin, mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI), mammary-derived growth
      factor-1 (MDGF-1), inhibins, activins, androgens, glucocorticoids, vitamin D,
      thyroid hormones, ecosinoids, and oxytocin. Clearly, the hormonal regulation of
      breast cancer cell growth and survival is multifaceted and very complex. In
      particular, the effects of estrogens and anti-estrogens on breast cells may
      depend on their interaction with a wide variety of other pathways. In addition,
      these interactions may vary among individual breast tumors depending on other
      genetic changes in the tumor cells that have not been discussed here, such as
      oncogene activation and loss of tumor suppressors. A more detailed understanding 
      of how cells circumvent a dependency on these pathways is greatly needed in order
      to identify new biological targets and to design novel therapies for breast
      cancers that are resistant to anti-estrogen therapy. Such agents could be used
      alone or in combination with anti-estrogens to improve response to a second
      course of hormonal therapy.

TI  - Identification of a GABP alpha/beta binding site involved in the induction of
      oxytocin receptor gene expression in human breast cells, potentiation by
      c-Fos/c-Jun.
PG  - 2268-79
AB  - Oxytocin (OT) receptors (OTRs) mediate reproductive functions, including the
      initiation of labor and milk ejection. OTR messenger RNA levels are highly
      regulated, reaching the greatest concentration in the uterus at the end of
      gestation, and in the mammary gland during lactation. Factors directly effecting 
      changes in OTR gene expression in the mammary gland are not known, so the present
      studies were done to elucidate possible regulators by characterizing the human
      OTR gene promoter and 5'-flanking sequence. By analyzing expression of
      promoter-luciferase constructs, we localized a region between -85 and -65 that
      was required for both basal and serum-induced expression in a mammary tumor cell 
      line (Hs578T) that expresses inducible, endogenous OTRs. This DNA region contains
      an ets family target sequence (5'-GGA-3'), and a CRE/AP-1-like motif. The
      specific Ets factor binding to the OTR promoter was identified, by
      electrophoretic mobility immunoshift assays, to be GABP alpha/beta.
      Co-transfection of a -85 OTR/luciferase construct with vectors expressing GABP
      alpha and GABP beta1 had only a modest effect on expression, but cotransfection
      with GABP alpha/beta- with c-Fos/c-Jun-expressing plasmids resulted in an
      increase of almost 10-fold in luciferase activity. Mutation of either the GABP-
      or CRE-like binding sites obliterated the induction. These findings are
      consistent with the involvement of protein kinase C activity in serum induction
      of the endogenous gene in Hs578T cells. We showed the requirement for GABP
      alpha/beta and c-Fos/c-Jun in endogenous OTR gene expression, using
      oligonucleotide GABP and AP-1 binding decoys to inhibit serum-induced increases
      in 125I-labeled OT antagonist binding to Hs578T cells. Our work is the first
      characterization of the proximal promoter region of the human OTR gene, and it
      sets the stage for studying regulation of OTR expression in breast cells.

TI  - Demonstration of functional oxytocin receptors in human breast Hs578T cells and
      their up-regulation through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway.
PG  - 2258-67
AB  - Oxytocin (OT) receptors (OTRs) have been demonstrated in a number of human breast
      tumors and tumor cells, but it was not clear whether the receptors were
      functional. We examined the regulation and function of OTR in a tumor cell line, 
      Hs578T, derived from human breast. These cells expressed moderate levels of OTR
      when cultured in 10% FBS, as demonstrated by RT-PCR and binding analyses. Serum
      deprivation resulted in the loss of OTRs, with no effect on cell viability.
      Restoration of serum and addition of 1 microM dexamethasone (DEX) increased OTR
      levels by about 9-fold. Up-regulation was blocked by the addition of
      phospholipase C and PKC inhibitors. Serum/DEX treatment also increased steady
      state OTR messenger RNA levels. OT increased intracellular Ca2+ in a time- and
      dose-responsive manner, and the effects of OT were lost when OTRs were
      down-regulated by serum starvation. Serum/DEX up-regulation of OTR restored the
      responsiveness to OT. OT also stimulated ERK-2 (extracellular signal-regulated
      protein kinase) phosphorylation and PGE2 synthesis in Hs578T cells. In addition
      to showing that OTRs in the breast tumor cells are functional, these studies show
      that Hs578T cells can be used to study molecular regulation of OTR gene
      expression and intracellular signaling pathways stimulated by OT.

TI  - Effects of providing hospital-based doulas in health maintenance organization
      hospitals.
PG  - 422-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether providing doulas during hospital-based labor
      affects mode of delivery, epidural use, breast-feeding, and postpartum
      perceptions of the birth, self-esteem, and depression. METHODS: This was a
      randomized study of nullipara enrollees in a group-model health maintenance
      organization who delivered in one of three health maintenance
      organization-managed hospitals; 149 had doulas, and 165 had usual care. Study
      data were obtained from the mothers' medical charts, study intake forms, and
      phone interviews conducted 4-6 weeks postpartum. RESULTS: Women who had doulas
      had significantly less epidural use (54.4% versus 66.1%, P < .05) than women in
      the usual-care group. They also were significantly (P < .05) more likely to rate 
      the birth experience as good (82.5% versus 67.4%), to feel they coped very well
      with labor (46.8% versus 28.3%), and to feel labor had a very positive effect on 
      their feelings as women (58.0% versus 43.7%) and perception of their bodies'
      strength and performance (58.0% versus 41.0%). The two groups did not differ
      significantly in rates of cesarean, vaginal, forceps, or vacuum delivery,
      oxytocin administration; or breast-feeding, nor did they differ on the postpartum
      depression or self-esteem measures. CONCLUSION: For this population and setting, 
      labor support from doulas had a desirable effect on epidural use and women's
      perceptions of birth, but did not alter need for operative deliveries.

TI  - Oxytocin may mediate the benefits of positive social interaction and emotions.
PG  - 819-35
AB  - During breastfeeding or suckling, maternal oxytocin levels are raised by
      somatosensory stimulation. Oxytocin may, however, also be released by nonnoxious 
      stimuli such as touch, warm temperature etc. in plasma and in cerebrospinal
      fluid. Consequently, oxytocin may be involved in physiological and behavioral
      effects induced by social interaction in a more general context. In both male and
      female rats oxytocin exerts potent physiological antistress effects. If daily
      oxytocin injections are repeated over a 5-day period, blood pressure is decreased
      by 10-20 mmHg, the withdrawal latency to heat stimuli is prolonged, cortisol
      levels are decreased and insulin and cholecystokinin levels are increased. These 
      effects last from 1 to several weeks after the last injection. After repeated
      oxytocin treatment weight gain may be promoted and the healing rate of wounds
      increased. Most behavioral and physiological effects induced by oxytocin can be
      blocked by oxytocin antagonists. In contrast, the antistress effects can not,
      suggesting that unidentified oxytocin receptors may exist. The prolonged latency 
      in the tail-flick test can be temporarily reversed by administration of naloxone,
      suggesting that endogenous opioid activity has been increased by the oxytocin
      injections. In contrast, the long-term lowering of blood pressure and of cortisol
      levels as well as the sedative effects of oxytocin have been found to be related 
      to an increased activity of central alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Positive social
      interactions have been related to health-promoting effects. Oxytocin released in 
      response to social stimuli may be part of a neuroendocrine substrate which
      underlies the benefits of positive social experiences. Such processes may in
      addition explain the health-promoting effects of certain alternative therapies.
      Because of the special properties of oxytocin, including the fact that it can
      become conditioned to psychological state or imagery, oxytocin may also mediate
      the benefits attributed to therapies such as hypnosis or meditation.

PG  - 111-8
AB  - Arginine vasopressin is the main hormone involved in the regulation of body fluid
      osmolality. The hormone is released by the posterior pituitary whenever water
      deprivation causes an increased plasma osmolality or whenever the cardiovascular 
      system is challenged by hypovolaemia and/or hypotension. The main site of action 
      of this hormone is the renal collecting duct, but vasopressin is also a potent
      vasopressor and neurotransmitter, it has a role in the secretion of
      corticotrophin, in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, temperature and
      other visceral functions. Vasopressin also promotes the release of coagulation
      factors by vascular endothelium and increases platelet aggregability. In addition
      to its classical contractile effect on uterine myometrial and mammary glandular
      myoepithelial cells, oxytocin acts as neurotransmitter, stimulates endometrial
      prostaglandin production, pituitary prolactin secretion, luteolysis, sperm
      transport and natriuresis, and may play a role in immune function. Sensorial
      stimuli arising from the cervix and vagina as well as stimulation of the breast
      can induce secretion of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. There are many
      vasopressin and oxytocin analogues (agonists and antagonists) that are
      synthetized with the goal of increasing duration of action and selectivity for
      the receptor subtypes, while non-peptide antagonists are orally active. The
      oxytocin and the vasopressin V1a, V1b and V2 receptors have recently been cloned 
      and shown to form a sub-family within the large superfamily of G-protein-linked
      receptors. Renal V2 receptors mediate vasopressin-induced water reabsorption via 
      induction of intracellular cAMP production in collecting duct cells. Most
      remaining actions of vasopressin on blood vessel constriction, liver
      glycogenolysis, platelet adhesion, adrenal angiotensin II secretion and certain
      brain functions are mediated via V1a-type receptors that are coupled to a Gq/11
      protein. V1 receptor activation leads to stimulation of phospholipases C, D and
      A2, and an increase in intracellular calcium. Vasopressin stimulates pituitary
      corticotrophin release via a third vasopressin receptor type (V1b) which is
      present in corticotrophs. Oxytocin induces myometrial contraction, endometrial
      prostaglandin F2a production, mammary gland milk ejection, renal natriuresis and 
      specific sexual, affilitative and maternal behaviours via oxytocin receptors
      which are also coupled to a G1/11 protein. Although only one oxytocin receptor
      type has been cloned so far, recent binding studies indicate that uterine
      endometrial oxytocin receptors may constitute a distinct receptor subtype.
      Expression of oxytocin receptors have relevant up- and down-regulation by
      oestrogens and progesterone.

TI  - Expression and immunolocalization of the oxytocin receptor in human lactating and
      non-lactating mammary glands.
PG  - 2645-53
AB  - The milk ejection reflex is mediated by the release of pituitary oxytocin and its
      interaction with specific receptors within the mammary gland. Although
      up-regulation of the oxytocin receptor during lactation has been shown for the
      rat mammary gland by ligand binding assay, investigation of the receptor
      expression in human breast at the molecular level has not yet been carried out in
      detail. Here we report the expression and immunolocalization of the oxytocin
      receptor in the human breast. It appears that the expression level of the
      receptor-specific mRNA is not significantly elevated during lactation and the
      protein remains at a relatively low level. However, this lack of increase may be 
      only a dilution effect because of the high level of milk protein expression.
      Immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy using three anti-oxytocin
      receptor antibodies raised against different epitopes of the receptor indicated
      the presence of receptor immunoreactivity only to a very limited extent in the
      myoepithelial cells; more specific expression appeared to occur in the
      ductal/glandular epithelium in both the non-lactating as well as lactating
      breast. This finding was also confirmed in a New World monkey, the common
      marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). These results suggest that, at least for human and
      marmoset, in addition to--or even instead of--myoid cells, the ductal/glandular
      epithelium is also a target for oxytocin action, not only during lactation but
      also in the non-lactating breast. Thus, there may be other physiological effects 
      of oxytocin besides direct myoid cell contraction in the breast.

      these findings are the newborn infant's ability to crawl toward the breast to
      initiate suckling and mother-infant thermoregulation. The attachment felt between
      mother and infant may be biochemically modulated through oxytocin; encouraging
      attachment through early contact, suckling, and rooming-in has been shown to

PG  - 2181-6
AB  - In the present work, first we reviewed and completed our previous experiments on 
      the antiproliferative effect of oxytocin (OT) in breast cancer cell lines. In
      vitro, OT 10 nM and 100 nM inhibited cell proliferation of MDA-MB231 (human
      breast carcinoma) and TS/A (mouse mammary carcinoma) cell lines. In vivo, OT
      significantly reduced the growth of TS/A mammary tumors. Both effects are
      mediated by specific receptors (OTR) distributed on cell surface. Second, using
      immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR we detected OTR and OTR mRNA in normal and
      pathological breast tissue. There is no correlation among OTR presence in breast 
      carcinomas and the age of patients, tumor stage, estrogen receptor positivity,
      oncogene expression and proliferation rate of the same tumor. On the contrary,
      progesterone and OTR expression are correlated. These data confirm our previous
      evidence of a role of OT and OTR in normal and neoplastic breast cells.

AB  - To determine whether oxytocin (OT) could be added to the list of growth factors
      acting on neoplastic cells of nervous origin, we investigated the presence of
      oxytocin receptors (OTR) in human primary neuroblastomas and glioblastomas and
      related cell lines. OTR were demonstrated both at mRNA level (using a RT-PCR
      procedure) and at protein level (using immunocytochemical and immunofluorescence 
      procedures). In order to clarify whether OT exerts any biological effect on these
      tumors through OTR, we also studied cell proliferation in 3 human neuroblastoma
      cell lines (SK-N-SH, SH-SY5Y, IMR-32) and one human anaplastic astrocytoma cell
      line (MOG-G-UVW) treated with OT 1 nM to 100 nM for 48 and 96 hr. At these doses,
      a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell proliferation was demonstrated. This
      inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase in the intracellular
      concentration of cAMP, which we have reported to be the intracellular mediator of
      the OT anti-proliferative effect in breast-carcinoma cell lines. Our data
      indicate that specific OTR are present in human neuroblastomas and glioblastomas.
      Through these receptors, OT could inhibit cell proliferation and modulate tumor
      growth.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate if personality profiles
      reflecting anxiety and social interaction of mothers who delivered by Cesarean
      section (CS) or by the vaginal route (VD) differed in early postpartum and to
      investigate whether these personality traits were correlated with hormonal data. 
      Seventeen women delivered by emergency CS and 20 by the vaginal route were
      selected for this study. The amount of milk transferred to the baby was measured.
      Blood samples were collected during the second breast-feeding on the second day
      after delivery. The samples were analysed for oxytocin and prolactin. After
      breastfeeding, the mothers were asked to fill in the personality inventory,
      Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP). The scores were compared between the two 
      groups and with a normative group of women. Each scale on the personality
      inventory was correlated with hormonal parameters. The KSP showed significant
      differences between the delivered mothers and the normative group in variables
      related to anxiety and socialization. The VD mothers deviated more than the CS
      mothers from the normative group. Correlations with hormonal data indicated that 
      anxiety was inversely related with basal levels of oxytocin and prolactin in the 
      CS mothers, whereas the pulsatility of oxytocin was related to social
      desirability in both groups. Social desirability and oxytocin pulsativity were
      also correlated with the amount of milk transferred from the mother to the baby. 
      The correlations indicate that central oxytocin, as reflected by basal plasma
      levels and patterns, may be involved in behavioral adaptations to the maternal
      role.

TI  - NGF, cyclic AMP, and phorbol esters regulate oxytocin receptor gene transcription
      in SK-N-SH and MCF7 cells.
PG  - 130-7
AB  - Oxytocin receptor (OTR) gene transcription has predominantly been thought to be
      regulated by estrogen. However, the continuous presence of receptors in certain
      brain regions after gonadectomy suggests the existence of alternate mechanisms of
      regulation. We have cloned and sequenced 4 kb of 5'-flanking DNA of the rat OTR
      gene and identified an internal segment which was absent in the initial
      publication of this promoter sequence. Sequence analysis of this segment, as well
      as of a novel upstream region, revealed the presence of a CRE as well as several 
      other potential regulatory elements, including AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, AP-4 sites, an
      ERE, and a half-SRE (SRE/2). The effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
      (PMA), forskolin, and NGF treatment on this promoter were tested in transfection 
      experiments in MCF7 and SK-N-SH cells. Transcription of the full-length OTR
      promoter was induced by forskolin and by the phorbol ester PMA, and a synergistic
      (17-fold) effect was observed in MCF7 cells treated with both agents. Receptor
      binding studies using the OTR antagonist 125I-labeled ornithine vasotocin, and
      Western blot analyses of OTRs in MCF7 cells, showed that PMA and forskolin also
      increased the density of endogenous human oxytocin receptors. Mutational analyses
      of the CRE and half-SRE sites in this promoter indicated that these elements
      function as enhancers and support forskolin and NGF effects, respectively, on
      transcription. These studies have identified a novel region of the rat OTR
      promoter containing elements which impart cAMP and/or phorbol ester inducibility 
      of OTR gene transcription. A potential role of the PKA and/or PKC pathways in OTR
      gene regulation is suggested.

TI  - Oxytocin inhibits the proliferation of MDA-MB231 human breast-cancer cells via

PG  - 340-4
AB  - Oxytocin (OT) inhibits the proliferation of breast-cancer cells in vitro via a
      specific G-coupled receptor. To elucidate the intracellular mechanism involved in
      this biological effect, different G-coupled receptor mediators have been
      investigated in untreated and OT-treated MDA-MB231 breast-carcinoma cells. In
      these cells, after OT treatment, a significant cAMP increase was observed using a
      radioimmunoassay procedure, whereas the Ca2+ (determined with the fluorescent
      probe fura-2) and the inositol phosphate (determined after cell labeling with
      myo(2-(3)H)-inositol) concentrations were not modified, contrary to what has been
      observed in myometrial and myo-epithelial cells. The PKA inhibitor PKI (6-22)
      amide reverted the effect of OT, indicating that the anti-proliferative effect of
      the peptide is strictly related to the cAMP-PKA pathway. OT treatment did not
      modify tyrosine phosphorylation either. Our results indicate that in breast
      epithelial cells devoid of contractile activity, cAMP is the intracellular
      mediator of OT action, whereas the Ca2+-phosphoinositide system is not involved.

TI  - Lactational headache: a lactation consultant's diary.
PG  - 51-3
AB  - There are few references to lactational cephalalgia (headache) in the literature,
      and these few such headaches are attributed to oxytocin surges associated with
      the milk-ejection reflex. The case described here differs, in that the apparent
      trigger was overfulness, rather than an oxytocin surge, that occurred when the
      infant began sleeping through the night or after a missed, delayed, or partial
      feed. Headaches were relieved by putting the baby to the breast and the resultant
      milk-ejection reflex. This case study describes maternal coping strategies from 5
      months postpartum until weaning was completed at 12 months.

TI  - Methods of cervical ripening and labor induction.
PG  - 71-85
AB  - The overall rate of induction of labor in the United States in 1993 was 134 per
      1,000 live births, or over 527,000 of the four million births that occur annually
      in the United States. Indications for labor induction include postdate pregnancy,
      premature rupture of membranes (PROM), and maternal medical complications, such
      as diabetes mellitus and pregnancy-induced hypertension. This article briefly
      reviews common indications for induction of labor and the importance of cervical 
      ripening. It then addresses methods used to hasten cervical ripening and to
      induce labor, ranging from the more "natural" and noninvasive methods, such as
      nipple stimulation, to the newest commercially available formulation of
      prostaglandin. Methods well documented in the scientific literature, as well as
      those commonly used but less well studied, are included. Although one may argue
      about the "invasive" nature of these methods, they are addressed, in general,
      from the most natural methods to the latest pharmacologic methods, and they
      include the following: sexual intercourse, nipple/breast stimulation, herbal
      preparations, homeopathic solutions, castor oil, enemas, acupuncture, membrane
      sweeping or stripping, mechanical dilation (balloon catheters, laminaria, and
      synthetic osmotic dilators), amniotomy, and pharmacologic hormonal preparations
      (prostaglandin E2, oxytocin, misoprostol, mifepristone, and relaxin).

PG  - 146-63
AB  - Nonnoxious sensory stimulation associated with friendly social interaction
      induces a psychophysiological response pattern involving sedation, relaxation,
      decreased sympathoadrenal activity, and increased vagal nerve tone and thereby an
      endocrine and metabolic pattern favoring the storage of nutrients and growth. It 
      is suggested that oxytocin released from parvocellular neurons in the
      paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in response to nonnoxious stimulation integrates
      this response pattern at the hypothalamic level. The response pattern just
      described characterized by calm, relaxation, and anabolic metabolism could be
      regarded as an antithesis to the well known fight-flight response in which mental
      activation, locomotor activity, and catabolic metabolism are expressed.
      Furthermore, the health-promoting aspect of friendly and supportive relationships
      might be a consequence of repetitive exposure to nonnoxious sensory stimulation
      causing the physiological endocrine and behavioral changes just described.

TI  - Health effects of breast feeding for mothers: a critical review.
PG  - 35-56
LID - 10.1079/NRR19970004 [doi]
AB  - Lactation results in a number of physiological adaptations which exert direct
      effects on maternal health, some of which may confer both short and long term
      advantages for breast feeding mothers. Breast feeding in the early postpartum
      period promotes a more rapid return of the uterus to its prepregnant state
      through the actions of oxytocin. Breast feeding may also lead to a more rapid
      return to prepregnancy weight. Among studies that had good data on duration and
      intensity of lactation, the majority show a significant association between
      lactation and weight loss. However, there is no evidence that lactation prevents 
      obesity. Lactation also affects glucose and lipid metabolism. The long term
      effects of these adaptations are unknown but may have implications for preventing
      subsequent development of diabetes and heart disease. Lactation delays the return
      of ovulation and significantly reduces fertility during the period of lactational
      amenorrhoea. This process is linked with feeding patterns and may therefore be
      affected by practices such as scheduled feedings and the timing of introduction
      of complementary foods. While the evidence from epidemiologic studies is mixed,
      several large studies have shown that extended lactation is associated with
      reduced risk of premenopausal breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers. Although
      bone mineralization declines during lactation, repletion takes place after
      weaning. As a result, breast feeding does not appear to cause long term depletion
      of bone nor does it increase risk of osteoporosis. Many of the physiological
      effects of lactation are dependent on the stimulation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary axis and milk removal and thus may vary with infant
      feeding practices. Well controlled studies are needed that include detailed
      information regarding infant feeding practices in addition to the total duration 
      of any breast feeding. Future feeding recommendations should reflect careful
      consideration of how such practices affect both infant and maternal health.

TI  - Studies on cutaneous blood flow in the mammary gland of lactating rats.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - The mechanisms that regulate mammary blood flow during lactation are not fully
      understood. In the present study laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) was used to
      measure blood flow in the cutaneous microvessels of the mammary gland of
      lactating rats. The effects of suckling on blood flow were examined, as were
      those of local injection of oxytocin (0.5-5 mU) and the vasoactive peptides
      calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; 0.1-10 pmol), vasoactive intestinal
      polypeptide (VIP; 0.4-20 pmol) and neuropeptide Y (NPY; 1-40 pmol). Blood flow
      responses to suckling varied depending on how much time had lapsed since the
      previous suckling. In rats with milk in the gland, suckling caused an initial
      increase in blood flow. In connection with milk let-down, the blood flow
      decreased, but was followed by a second increase. In recently suckled rats with
      no milk in the gland the increase in blood flow corresponded to the number of
      pups suckling. Oxytocin injections also had varying effects on mammary blood flow
      depending on how recently suckling had taken place. In non-suckled rats with milk
      in the gland, oxytocin injections caused a rise in blood flow that was
      interrupted by a fall during milk ejection. In recently suckled rats, all doses
      of oxytocin caused an increase in blood flow of similar magnitude. However, the
      effect of the higher doses had a longer duration. CGRP and VIP injections caused 
      a dose-dependent increase in mammary blood flow regardless of when suckling last 
      occurred. NPY injections caused a dose-dependent decrease in blood flow.

AB  - The effects of two uterotonics, Oxytocin and Ergotocin, on postpartum lactation
      were observed and compared in this study. 30 puerperants were given Oxytocin and 
      another 30 puerperants were given Ergotocin during delivery. The result showed
      that the time of lactation for the Oxytocin group was earlier than that of the
      Ergotocin group. The amount of lactation of the Oxytocin group was also much more
      than that of the Ergotocin group. This study indicated that the rate of
      breast-feeding may increase if the uterotonics are used properly during delivery.

TI  - Oxytocin and oxytocin-analogue F314 inhibit cell proliferation and tumor growth
      of rat and mouse mammary carcinomas.
PG  - 817-20
AB  - The effects of oxytocin (OT) and the OT-analogue F314 were investigated an
      xenografts of mouse mammary and colon carcinomas (TS/A and C26 tumors) and of rat
      mammary carcinoma (D-R3230AC). In all cases, proliferation was previously
      assessed by cell counting in cultured cell lines, whereas tumor growth was
      checked by serial measures of tumor volume and by evaluation of tumor weight at
      the end of the experiment. Both cell proliferation and tumor growth were
      inhibited by OT and F314. These data support previous observations on the
      inhibitory effect of OT and F314 on the growth of MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB231 human 
      breast cancer cell lines and open new prospects for testing the effect of this
      hypothalamic hormone and its analogues on the control of breast carcinoma growth.

TI  - Immunolocalization and gene expression of oxytocin receptors in carcinomas and
      non-neoplastic tissues of the breast.
PG  - 1895-903
AB  - Recent evidence indicates that oxytocin (OT), in addition to the induction of
      myometrial and myoepithelial cell contraction, can influence proliferation and
      differentiation in developing mammary glands and in breast cancer cells, hence
      the interest in detecting and locating OT receptors (OTRs). We produced rabbit
      antisera and a monoclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to
      the carboxy terminus of the predicted OTR sequence. We tested their specificity
      in immunoblasts and immunocytochemical tests. All of the antibodies specifically 
      stained myometrium (at term of pregnancy). In the human breast, OTRs were
      detected in myoepithelial cells along ducts of normal lobules and in sclerosing
      adenosis. Intraductal cells in benign hyperplastic lesions were also positive.
      OTRs were demonstrated in cases of primary and metastatic carcinomas of the
      breast. In the same tissues, OTR gene expression was shown by reverse
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction procedures detecting the specific mRNA.
      These results suggest that the interaction between OT and its receptors might
      play a role in the origin and evolution of non-neoplastic lesions and carcinomas 
      of the breast.

TI  - Breastfeeding: physiological, endocrine and behavioural adaptations caused by
      oxytocin and local neurogenic activity in the nipple and mammary gland.
PG  - 525-30
AB  - It is now well established that oxytocin, as well as stimulating uterine
      contractions and milk ejection, promotes the development of maternal behaviour
      and also bonding between mother and offspring. In addition, oxytocin exerts by
      way of peripheral, circulating as well as by central, neurogenic mechanisms
      multiple physiological, endocrine and behavioural effects in connection with milk
      ejection and lactation. Some effects of oxytocin in the nipple and mammary gland 
      appear to be exerted in close collaboration with peptides released from axon
      collaterals of somatosensory nerves originating in this region. The distribution 
      of peptides localized to the somatosensory afferents in the nipple and mammary
      gland as well as possible effects by oxytocin and/or local neurogenic peptides in
      connection with milk ejection and lactation are reviewed in this paper.

      using newly established monoclonal antibodies.
PG  - 773-9
AB  - The expression of the oxytocin (OT) receptor (OTR) in breast cancer was studied
      using newly established anti-OTR monoclonal antibodies. Immunoblotting indicated 
      that the antibody 2F8 recognized a 70K OTR in the pregnant myometrium and breast 
      cancer tissue. Among 57 breast cancer patients, we detected OTR immunoreactivity 
      in 52 (91.2%) by immunohistochemistry using 2F8. Using another monoclonal
      antibody for different receptor domains, 1-2, the staining profile was identical 
      in all positive samples. Of 52 OTR-positive samples, 28 were diffusely positive
      (> 80% of cancer cells were stained), and 24 were partially positive (< 80% cells
      were stained). The ratio of estrogen receptor-positive samples was slightly
      higher among those that were diffusely positive, but there was no apparent
      relationship between OTR expression and other clinical parameters. We also
      confirmed the expression of the OTR in positively stained samples by means of
      Northern blotting and RT-PCR at the transcription level. The OTR messenger RNA
      and RT-PCR product were the same size as those in the pregnant myometrium. We
      also determined the expression of the OTR using flow cytometry in four breast
      cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, and MDA-MB-468). However, OT
      had no significant effect on their growth during a short period (7 days) of
      culture. These findings indicated that the OTR is expressed in breast cancer
      derived not from the myoepithelium but from the glandular or ductal epithelium;
      however, the biological function of OT in breast cancer remains to be determined.

TI  - Vasopressin and oxytocin receptors.
PG  - 75-96
AB  - The oxytocin and the vasopressin V1a, V1b and V2 receptors have recently been
      cloned and shown to form a sub-family within the large superfamily of
      G-protein-linked receptors. Renal V2 receptors mediate vasopressin-induced water 
      reabsorption via induction of intracellular cAMP production in collecting duct
      cells. Most remaining actions of vasopressin on blood vessel constriction, liver 
      glycogenolysis, platelet adhesion, adrenal angiotensin II secretion and certain
      brain functions are mediated via v1a-type receptors that are coupled to a Gq/11
      protein. V1 receptor activation leads to stimulation of phospholipases C, D and
      A2 and an increase in intracellular calcium. Vasopressin stimulates pituitary
      corticotrophin release via a third vasopressin receptor type (V1b) which is
      present on corticotrophs. Oxytocin induces myometrial contraction, endometrial
      prostaglandin F2 alpha production, mammary gland milk ejection, renal natriuresis
      and specific sexual, affiliative and maternal behaviours via oxytocin receptors
      which are also coupled to a Gq/11 protein. Although only one oxytocin receptor
      type has been cloned so far, recent binding studies indicate that uterine
      endometrial oxytocin receptors may constitute a distinct receptor subtype. In
      contrast to most other membrane receptors, the expression of oxytocin receptors
      undergoes very rapid and physiologically relevant up-and-down-regulation. A >
      100-fold up-regulation of uterine oxytocin receptors occurs during gestation and 
      may represent the trigger for parturition. Indeed, oxytocin receptor antagonists 
      are able to counteract preterm labour and may soon be available for clinical use.
      The presence of oxytocin receptors on breast cancer cells and the
      growth-inhibitory effects of OT suggest a potential use of oxytocin analogues for
      breast cancer treatment. Whereas no mutations of the oxytocin or V1a or V1b
      receptors have been found, over 60 different genetic mutations of the (renal) V2 
      receptor have been described which represent the cause for congenital nephrogenic
      diabetes insipidus.

PG  - 3518-21
AB  - Quality assurance in the care of breast-feeding women and their nursing infants
      also applies to drugs administered during delivery and puerperium. Large
      variations among hospitals may indicate that drug use is irrational. A survey
      comparing the extent of drug sales from the hospital pharmacy to maternity wards 
      in eight Norwegian hospitals was performed in 1992 and the results were compared 
      with data from 1988. The purpose was to examine whether the drug use was
      "baby-friendly" with regard to the following criteria; proven efficacy for the
      indication; no effect on milk ejection, milk production and interaction with
      infant; minimal transfer of drug to milk. Large variations were found among
      hospitals in the case of some oxytocic drugs. High use of oxytocin as nasal spray
      and metylergometrine as tablets may indicate unnecessary use of drugs. A large
      decrease (89%) in the use of hypnotics was found from 1988 to 1992, which may
      indicate previous irrational use of these drugs. Pethidine as pain relief during 
      delivery remained stable during this period, and was received by 40-60% of women 
      giving birth. None of the drugs given to the mothers was assessed to represent a 
      risk to the breast-fed infant. In general, drug use in maternity wards had
      decreased during the last four years and, with some exceptions, appeared to be
      more baby-friendly.

TI  - Suppression of hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to stress in
      lactating women.
PG  - 2954-9
AB  - In the rat, lactation suppresses a variety of physiological responses to stress. 
      We investigated whether stress-responsive neurohormonal systems are also
      restrained during breast feeding in humans. We chose treadmill exercise as a
      stressor because this stimulus produces an exercise intensity-dependent
      activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathomedullary
      system that is independent of differences in physical conditioning among
      subjects. Ten lactating and ten nonlactating women who were between 7 and 18
      weeks postpartum performed 20 min of graded treadmill exercise. The final 5 min
      of exercise was set to elicit 90% of the maximal oxygen uptake of each subject.
      Plasma ACTH, cortisol, and glucose responses to exercise were significantly
      attenuated in lactating women (P < 0.001, P < 0.05, and P < 0.001, respectively).
      Basal norepinephrine levels were also reduced in lactating women (P < 0.05).
      These results indicate that stress-responsive neurohormonal systems are
      restrained in lactating women.

TI  - Thirst induced by a suckling episode during breast feeding and relation with
      plasma vasopressin, oxytocin and osmoregulation.
PG  - 277-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There have been anecdotal reports of increased maternal thirst during 
      breast feeding, but the physiological mechanisms remain obscure. We have assessed
      and quantified the stimulation of maternal thirst during breast feeding
      (suckling), and correlated the changes with plasma oxytocin and vasopressin
      levels. DESIGN: A within subject design was used with each subject acting as her 
      own control. Each subject participated in a suckling period and a control
      non-suckling period the order of which was counterbalanced. SUBJECTS: Ten healthy
      breastfeeding women ranging from 28 to 52 days post partum. MEASUREMENTS: Thirst 
      (assessed by a visual analogue scale), plasma vasopressin, plasma oxytocin (pOT),
      plasma osmolality and haematocrit, blood pressure, volume of milk transferred to 
      baby, volume of water drunk immediately following each experimental period.
      RESULTS: Thirst increased significantly more over a suckling period than over a
      comparable control period (P = 0.013). The peak level of thirst correlated with
      the volume of water consumed to satiety following the suckling period (r = 0.7, P
      = 0.024). As expected, pOT levels rose significantly in response to suckling (P <
      0.001). Six women demonstrated a close relation between thirst and oxytocin
      response during the suckling period. Despite significant changes in thirst during
      suckling there was no increase in plasma vasopressin or in osmoregulatory
      parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that suckling is a potent stimulus
      to thirst in the mother, and is not associated with vasopressin release or
      dependent on any measurable alterations in osmoregulation. What actually
      stimulates thirst during breast feeding remains unknown, but there are two
      potential explanations for these observations: (1) suckling sends nerve impulses 
      to the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei in the hypothalamus which may have
      afferents within the central nervous system which stimulates a thirst response
      simultaneous with oxytocin release; (ii) a learned anticipation of thirst may be 
      occurring in a situation associated with expectant fluid loss to preserve
      homeostasis.

TI  - The potential for oxytocin (OT) to prevent breast cancer: a hypothesis.
PG  - 225-9
AB  - This hypothesis proposes that carcinogens in the breast are generated by the
      action of superoxide free radicals released when acinal gland distension, under
      the influence of unopposed prolactin, causes microvessel ischaemia. Inadequate
      nipple care in the at-risk years leads to ductal obstruction preventing the
      elimination of carcinogens from the breast. The regular production of oxytocin
      (OT) from nipple stimulation would cause contraction of the myoepithelial cells, 
      relieving acinal gland distension and aiding the active elimination of
      carcinogenic fluid from the breast. Mechanical breast pump stimulation causes an 
      increase in plasma OT levels in the luteal but not in the follicular phase of the
      menstrual cycle. OT production upon nipple stimulation in the luteal phase of
      premenopausal, non-lactating women may be protective against the high rates of
      mitotic breast cell division noted at this time via the potential to block the
      effect of oestrogen. The epidemiology of breast cancer suggests that lengthy
      lactation time is beneficial. Sexual activity in nulliparous women also protects 
      and OT levels have been shown to rise with orgasm in women and in men. OT systems
      in the brain are intricately linked to oestrogen and progesterone levels, and it 
      is possible that these hormones may modify the OT secretory response both
      centrally and through an effect on the sensitivity of the breast. OT production
      with nipple care and in sex and lactation, and the reduction in cycling ovarian
      hormones that occurs with pregnancy, may all be important preventative factors in
      the development of breast cancer both pre- and post-menopausally.

TI  - Elevation of oxytocin levels early post partum in women.
PG  - 530-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine plasma levels of oxytocin in
      women immediately after delivery. METHODS: Oxytocin was measured in 18 healthy
      women at 15 minute intervals after normal vaginal deliveries with healthy
      infants. The mothers had their infants put skin-to-skin on their chests
      immediately after birth. The infants stayed there up to two hours post partum.
      RESULTS: There were significant elevations of oxytocin 15, 30 and 45 minutes
      after delivery (p = 0.007, 0.02 and 0.02 respectively) when compared with average
      pre partum levels sampled approximately 7-15 minutes before partus. This
      elevation of oxytocin coincided with the expulsion of placenta. In most women
      this first elevation was followed by repeated elevations of oxytocin. Oxytocin
      levels returned to pre partum levels at 60 minutes post partum. CONCLUSIONS:
      Oxytocin is known to play a role in maternal bonding in animals. Earlier studies 
      indicate that there is a sensitive period for bonding the first hour after giving
      birth even in women. Our study demonstrates a coincidence of this putative
      'sensitive period' and high levels of oxytocin.

TI  - Vasopressin gene related products are markers of human breast cancer.
PG  - 229-35
AB  - Immunohistochemical analysis for products of vasopressin and oxytocin gene
      expression was performed on acetone-fixed tissues from 19 breast cancers
      representing a variety of tumor sub-types. Studies employed the avidin-biotin
      complex (ABC) immunohistochemical procedure and utilized rabbit polyclonal
      antibodies to arginine vasopressin (VP), provasopressin (ProVP),
      vasopressin-associated human glycopeptide (VAG), oxytocin (OT),
      oxytocin-associated human neurophysin (OT-HNP), and a mouse monoclonal antibody
      to vasopressin-associated human neurophysin (VP-HNP). Western Blot analysis was
      performed on protein extracts of fresh-frozen tissues from 12 additional breast
      tumors. While VP gene related proteins were not detected in normal breast tissue,
      immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of VP, ProVP, and VAG in all
      neoplastic cells for all of the tumor tissues examined. Vasopressin-associated
      human neurophysin was evident in only one of 19 acetone-fixed tumor preparations.
      However, Western blot analysis for all 12 fresh-frozen tumor samples showed the
      presence of two proteins, 42,000 and 20,000 daltons, that were immunoreactive
      with antibodies to VP, VP-HNP, and VAG. Oxytocin and OT-HNP, by
      immunohistochemistry, were found to be common to cells of normal breast tissues. 
      For tumors, positive staining for OT was observed in 8 of 18 tumors, while OT-HNP
      was not detected in any of the tumors examined. These findings indicate that VP
      gene expression is a selective feature of all breast cancers, and that products
      of this expression might therefore be useful as markers for early detection of
      this disease and as possible targets for immunotherapy.

TI  - [The effect of sodium prasterone sulfate on lactation].
PG  - 197-9
AB  - To study the relationship between sodium prasterone sulfate and lactation, blood 
      samples were collected from 120 cases. Sixty cases were in study group (at
      different periods: during the 3rd trimester, and 1st, 3rd day postpartum)
      including 30 cases using 100mg sodium prasterone sulfate, 30 cases (using 200mg
      sodium prasterone sulfate), 60 cases were in control group. The serum levels of
      estradiol (E2), prolactin (PRL) and plasma levels of oxytocin (OT) were measured 
      by radioimmunoassay, and the production of breast milk was observed. The results 
      showed no statistically significant difference of serum E2, PRL and plasma OT
      between (sodium prasterone sulfate) study groups and control groups, and the
      production of breast milk indicated also no significant difference between the 2 
      groups. The conclusion is that low-dose sodium prasterone sulfate (200mg/day,
      600mg/week) did not affect the production of breast milk.

TI  - Oxytocin and female sexuality.
PG  - 217-21
AB  - A search of the literature has been prepared to determine how oxytocin may affect
      sexual and reproductive in women. Many animal studies suggest that oxytocin
      induces a variety of reproductive behaviors, including grooming, sexual arousal, 
      orgasm, gamete transport, nesting, birthing, and specific maternal behaviors such
      as breast-feeding and bonding between mother and infant. These actions are
      apparently facilitated by the 'priming' effect on certain cells by sex and
      steroid hormones - as the brief case report would also suggest. However, no
      adequate double-blind trial has confirmed the observations from this report in
      women. Only animal studies have been performed, albeit over a wide range of
      species. A variety of other causes and effects of sexual interest and arousal
      relating to oxytocin are considered, including some of those in males. More
      research is needed to clarify the role of oxytocin in human reproductive
      behaviors, including its potential 'aphrodisiac' or prosexual effect in women in 
      the presence of the sex-steroid hormones.

TI  - Influence of psychological stress on suckling-induced pulsatile oxytocin release.
PG  - 259-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of psychological stress on
      suckling-induced oxytocin release. METHODS: The pulsatile release of
      suckling-induced oxytocin was measured in 22 puerperal women. The blood samples
      for oxytocin assay were collected at 2-minute intervals in a manner that
      minimized degradation by plasma oxytocinase, and were used for radioimmunoassay
      after extraction. RESULTS: The release of suckling-induced oxytocin during
      nursing is pulsatile, with discrete, short pulses. The frequency of pulsatile
      release of oxytocin was significantly lower in the two groups in which stress was
      imposed by mental calculation or noise than in the control group without stress
      (mental calculation group, 1.28 +/- 0.76 pulses/20-minute suckling period; noise 
      group, 1.14 +/- 0.38; control group, 2.25 +/- 0.71). However, there were no
      differences among the three groups in the increase of prolactin during nursing or
      in the milk yield. CONCLUSIONS: The release of suckling-induced oxytocin is
      pulsatile, and psychological stress reduces the pulsatile oxytocin release. Our
      data suggest that suckling-induced oxytocin release may be modulated by the
      central nervous system and that psychological relaxation is necessary for an
      adequate let-down response.

TI  - A simple alternative to parenteral oxytocics for the third stage of labor.
PG  - 15-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of nipple stimulation on uterine activity
      during the third stage of labor. METHODS: Randomized controlled study comparing; 
      (i) 15 min of nipple stimulation (n = 6), (ii) routine syntometrine injection (n 
      = 3), (iii) no action/control (N = 5). Uterine activity was continuously measured
      using the placenta as an in-situ hydrostatic bag connected to a pressure
      transducer. RESULTS: Compared to controls uterine pressure was higher during
      nipple stimulation (103 mmHg vs. 70.8 mmHg, P = 0.04). The duration of the third 
      stage and blood loss tended to be reduced with nipple stimulation compared to
      controls (20.3 vs. 12.3 min) and (257 vs. 166 ml) respectively but was not
      significant. Similar differences were observed between syntometrine and control
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: For women in developing countries where parenteral oxytocics
      are not available, nipple stimulation might reduce the incidence of postpartum
      hemorrhage. A larger trial now seems warranted.

TI  - Functional analysis of an alternatively spliced estrogen receptor lacking exon 4 
      isolated from MCF-7 breast cancer cells and meningioma tissue.
PG  - 237-45
AB  - An alternatively spliced mRNA coding for a variant estrogen receptor (ER) missing
      exon 4 (ERdelta4) was detected in the breast tumor cell line MCF7 and meningioma 
      tissue by using the reversed transcriptase PCR technique. The trans-activational 
      properties of this mutant ER were assessed in embryo carcinoma P19EC and human
      choriocarcinoma JEG3 cells by co-transfection of the ERdelta4 expression vector
      with an oxytocin promoter construct containing an estrogen-responsive element.
      ERdelta4 did not trans-activate the oxytocin promoter in either a
      hormone-dependent or -independent manner. Co-transfection of ERdelta4 together
      with the wtER did not show any interference of ERdelta4 on the stimulation of the
      oxytocin promoter by the wtER. ERdelta4 was translated in vitro. Its capacity to 
      bind estradiol, and the binding of the variant to a synthetic estrogen-responsive
      element were compared to those of the wild-type receptor. ERdelta4 did not bind
      to a synthetic estrogen-responsive element, nor did it bind estradiol. Hence,
      ERdelta4 appears to be a silent variant and we speculate that it is without any
      role in tumor progression.

TI  - Physiological mechanisms underlying lactational amenorrhea.
PG  - 145-55
AB  - Breastfeeding delays the resumption of normal ovarian cycles by disrupting the
      pattern of pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus and hence LH from the 
      pituitary. The plasma concentrations of FSH during lactation are sufficient to
      induce follicle growth, but the inadequate pulsatile LH signal results in a
      reduced estradiol production by these follicles. When follicle growth and
      estradiol secretion does increase to normal, the suckling stimulus prevents the
      generation of a normal preovulatory LH surge and follicles either fail to
      rupture, or become atretic or cystic. Only when the suckling stimulus declines
      sufficiently to allow generation of a normal preovulatory LH surge to occur will 
      ovulation take place with the formation of a corpus luteum of variable normality.
      Thus suckling delays the resumption of normal ovarian cyclicity by disrupting but
      not totally inhibiting, the normal pattern of release of GnRH by the
      hypothalamus. The mechanism of suckling-induced disruption of GnRH release
      remains unknown. It does not appear to involve prolactin, dopamine or opiates
      although a combination of these factors might be involved. Prolactin is the major
      hormone responsible for milk production and is present in sufficient quantities
      in almost all women to allow the establishment of normal lactation. Oxytocin is
      essential for milk let down and is susceptible to inhibition of release by
      stress. The successful initiation of lactation which would lead to the potential 
      of utilizing breastfeeding as contraceptive may require more attention to be paid
      to the establishment of non-stress release of oxytocin.

TI  - Suckling-induced attenuation of plasma cortisol concentrations in postpartum
      lactating women.
PG  - 79-87
AB  - The effect of suckling on serum cortisol concentrations was assessed in
      postpartum lactating women studied during serial breast feeding sessions 1-24
      weeks postpartum. The mean +/- SD serum cortisol concentration at 15 min after
      the start of nursing, 9.8 +/- 3.89 micrograms/dl, was significantly lower, P =
      0.001, than prior to the start of nursing, 13.2 +/- 5.92 micrograms/dl. The
      decline in the serum cortisol concentrations in the breast feeding women was not 
      due entirely to the normal metabolism of the hormone or the normal circadian
      variation in cortisol secretion. These studies complement and expand upon a
      recent report [3] of a significant decrease in plasma adrenocorticotrophic
      hormone in breast feeding women studied one week postpartum. The neuroendocrine
      mechanisms responsible for this effect in women have yet to be defined.

TI  - Releases of oxytocin and prolactin during breast massage and suckling in
      puerperal women.
PG  - 17-20
AB  - The responses of prolactin (PRL) and oxytocin (OT) to suckling and breast massage
      were examined in lactating women. The suckling group showed increase in frequency
      of pulsatile release of OT and increase of the plasma PRL level. In contrast, the
      breast massage group showed a significant, but not a pulsatile increase in the
      plasma OT level and no increase in the plasma PRL level. These findings suggest
      that suckling causes both milk production and milk ejection, while breast massage
      causes only ejection of milk already stored in acini, and that prolactin release 
      is not related to increase of the oxytocin level itself, but to its pulsatile
      release.

      higher than generally reported in literature, 24% as opposed to 3%. The frequency
      of mastitis was similar among nulli- and multiparous women. The diagnosis was
      based on the judgement of midwives of physicians. If a multiparous woman has had 
      mastitis during a previous puerperium, the probability of mastitis during a
      subsequent puerperium is threefold. The type of skin, its reaction of the sun,
      allergies, rashes, getting cold and oxytocin medication during delivery did nto
      affect the incidence of mastitis. Mothers under 21 and over 35 years of age had a
      decreased incidence (P = 0.034) of mastitis. If the women had sore nipples, the
      frequency increased (P = 0.003). Prophylaxis, by means of physical training,
      neither decreased nor increased the frequency of puerperal mastitis. The
      treatment advised by midwives and physicians was primarily conservative, but 38% 
      received antibiotics; some of the antibiotics were not effective against
      staphylococcal infection.

PG  - 467-72
AB  - In this study we show that treatment of MDA-MB231 hormone-independent human
      breast cancer cells with oxytocin (OT) or with the OT analogue F314 induces
      significant growth inhibition together with a change in cell phenotype. In MCF7
      and T47D human breast cancer cells, OT inhibits oestrogen-induced cell growth. In
      these same cells, OT administration significantly enhances the inhibitory effect 
      of tamoxifen on cell proliferation. MDA-MB231, MCF7 and T47D cells all express
      mRNA specific for the OT receptor. These data suggest that it may be possible to 
      inhibit breast cancer growth using OT and OT analogues.

TI  - [The biological bases of human lactation].
PG  - 889-97
AB  - The mammary gland integrated by secretory acini has two main physiological goals:
      the lactogenesis and the milk ejection. The first is controlled by estrogens,
      prolactin and cortisol; the former by oxytocin. Milk is synthesized through five 
      mechanisms namely: I. Cellular synthesis and exocytosis; 2. Cellular synthesis
      and exocytosis packed in cell membrane fragment; 3. Passive transport through
      both cell membranes; 4. Active transport via receptors through both cell
      membranes, and 5. Paracellular transport. The human milk has a high concentration
      of lactose and relatively low concentrations of fat and protein in comparison to 
      other species. Its composition varies little in relationship to maternal diet,
      nevertheless, it holds a close correlation, with body composition of the mother. 
      Exclusively breast-fed infants grow in a similar manner to those formula-fed up
      to 4-6 months; afterwards growth decelerates, to spurt up the need for
      complementary food. It has been amply demonstrated that human milk protects
      against acute infections, both bacterial and viral. The current hospital
      practices of perinatal care should be changed in our country in order to favour
      the initiation of breast-feeding. Concerned physicians should have more and
      precise knowledge about the physiology of lactation in order to help mothers to
      pursue a successful lactation.

TI  - Parathyroid hormone-related peptide production and action in a myoepithelial cell
      line derived from normal human breast.
PG  - 1116-24
AB  - Physiological roles for PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) appear varied, but remain to 
      be clarified. The peptide is present in large amounts in milk, and PTHrP mRNA has
      been shown to be present in high amounts in lactating mammary gland. Because
      PTHrP can cause smooth muscle relaxation, we hypothesized that the peptide might 
      affect the contractility of the breast myoepithelial cell and thereby affect milk
      ejection. To test this idea, we asked whether PTHrP might affect second messenger
      responses in a human mammary gland myoepithelial-cell line (Hs578Bst) derived
      originally from normal breast tissue. To verify the presumed origin of these
      cells, we also examined the effects of oxytocin. Cells were grown in culture in
      multiwell plates and exposed to test peptides for 15 min in buffer containing 1
      mM isobutylmethylxanthine, and intracellular cAMP was measured by RIA. Both
      PTHrP-(1-34) and PTH-(1-34) increased cAMP in a dose-related fashion (ED50, 5
      nM), with a maximal effect (3-fold) occurring at 100 nM. The ability of PTHrP to 
      stimulate cAMP was inhibited by a 10- to 100-fold molar excess of the specific
      inhibitors, PTH-(3-34) or PTHrP-(7-34). Inhibitors alone did not alter cAMP.
      Oxytocin also produced an increase in cAMP, but the effect was inconsistent and
      occurred only with high doses (0.1-1 microM). Using cells grown on coverslips and
      loaded with fura-2AM, intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in cells exposed to test
      peptides. Oxytocin (0.2-20 nM) produced rapid dose-related increases in
      intracellular Ca2+, with a peak and plateau characteristic of initial
      mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, followed by entry of extracellular Ca. The
      plateau was eliminated by the Ca channel antagonist La3+ or by perfusion of cells
      with Ca-free medium. PTHrP (10-100 nM) altered the intracellular Ca2+ response to
      oxytocin in 66% of 39 preparations tested. PTHrP inhibited the Ca2+ response when
      given before oxytocin or transiently decreased the plateau phase of the Ca2+
      response when given after oxytocin. Analysis of cellular mRNA using reverse
      transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that these cells express the
      gene for PTHrP, and immunohistochemistry using antiserum to PTHrP revealed
      positive staining of cells. Measurement of immunoreactive PTHrP in conditioned
      medium confirmed that these cells can synthesize and secrete the peptide. The
      finding of a response of this cell line to oxytocin provides functional evidence 
      of their myoepithelial derivation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Transfer of carbetocin into human breast milk.
PG  - 456-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the transfer of carbetocin into human breast milk. METHODS:
      Five healthy nursing women, 7-14 weeks postpartum, emptied their breasts using a 
      breast pump and then received 70 micrograms carbetocin by intramuscular
      injection. Using a radioimmunoassay, the concentrations of carbetocin were
      measured in plasma and breast milk samples obtained before carbetocin
      administration and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 minutes after drug
      administration. RESULTS: For plasma, the mean (+/- standard deviation) area under
      the curve (AUC) of carbetocin versus time was 1119.3 +/- 315.9 pg/mL, a value
      about 50 times higher than the mean AUC for carbetocin in breast milk (18.6 +/-
      13.7 and 29.0 +/- 23.8 pg/mL for the right and left breast, respectively). The
      ratio of milk to plasma AUC was low: 1.7 +/- 0.9 and 3.1 +/- 2.8% for the left
      and right breast, respectively. No serious adverse reactions occurred and no
      clinically significant changes in vital signs were found. CONCLUSION: Very little
      carbetocin is transferred into human breast milk, presenting little risk to
      breast-fed infants.

TI  - A comparison of pregnancy care delivered by family physicians versus
      obstetricians in Lebanon.
PG  - 465-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: The provision of prenatal and intrapartum care is an important issue 
      in family practice. Physician specialty as a risk factor for adverse perinatal
      outcome is of interest to both educators and patients. The purpose of this study 
      is to compare perinatal care provided by family practice and obstetrics residents
      for low-risk women in Lebanon. METHODS: A study of 400 matched pairs of low-risk 
      pregnant women was conducted at the American University of Beirut Medical Center 
      to compare outcomes of perinatal care provided by family physicians and
      obstetricians. The medical records of women admitted for delivery at the American
      University of Beirut Medical Center between October 1, 1986, and October 1, 1990,
      were reviewed. RESULTS: Obstetricians used oxytocin induction significantly more 
      frequently than family physicians (43% versus 7%, P < .01). A similar significant
      difference was also noted for artificial rupture of membranes. There were similar
      episiotomy rates (63%), with a greater number of lacerations reported among women
      cared for by obstetricians (28% versus 15%, P < .05). The use of forceps was
      similar in both groups. Vacuum extraction was not used by family physicians.
      Neonatal outcomes were comparable, although meconium-stained amniotic fluid was
      more common in the obstetrics group (21% versus 6%, P < .05). During the
      postpartum period, significantly more women breast-fed (62% versus 45%, P < .01) 
      and used oral contraceptives in the family practice group. CONCLUSIONS: When
      caring for low-risk pregnant women, family physicians appear to provide
      comparable care with less intervention than obstetricians.

TI  - Electrical breast stimulation. Oxytocin, prolactin and uterine response.
PG  - 438-42
AB  - Electrical breast stimulation using a modified electromyograph was performed on
      10 pregnant women between 38 and 42 weeks of gestation. An adequate uterine
      contraction pattern (at least three contractions lasting > or = 30 seconds in a
      10-minute interval either recorded by external tochodynamometry, palpated and/or 
      felt by the patient) was obtained in 8 of the 10. Two patients, however, had
      uterine hyperstimulation (contractions lasting > 90 seconds). In contrast to
      previous reports, serum oxytocin levels increased significantly in 7 of the 10
      patients. Moreover, this increase preceded or was concomitant with the uterine
      contractions. Serum prolactin varied unpredictably following electrical breast
      stimulation. The stimulation was well tolerated, without any discomfort, by all
      the patients. Electrical breast stimulation can thus be used for the stimulation 
      of uterine contractions.

TI  - Breastfeeding after pituitary resection: support for a theory of autocrine
      control of milk supply?
PG  - 35-40
AB  - A 20-year-old woman with a history of pituitary resection complicated by diabetes
      insipidus was able to fully breastfeed for three months despite apparent
      hyposecretion of pituitary hormones. This case report adds to the growing body of
      evidence that control of milk production shifts from endocrine to autocrine
      control shortly after delivery. Autocrine control allows efficient regulation of 
      milk supply to match the needs of the infant. A recently discovered factor in
      human milk that inhibits lactose and casein synthesis in vitro is believed to be 
      responsible for local, short term control of milk production. This study suggests
      that practices which result in infrequent or incomplete removal of milk from the 
      breast lead to decreased milk production and should be abandoned.

      lactation.
PG  - 77-85
AB  - Continuous recordings of intramammary pressure performed in 158 normal lactating 
      women, and 22 women during spontaneous labor were retrospectively analyzed in
      order to characterize spontaneous milk ejecting activity (SA). SA appeared as
      spurts of contraction waves as early as the first post-partum day and throughout 
      the first two months of lactation. The spurts of SA differed from reflex milk
      ejection evoked by baby's suckling. It showed two different patterns: a) single
      contraction waves with a rapid rise time, a slow decay time, high amplitude and a
      short duration; b) multiple contraction waves with a longer rise and decay times,
      progressively decreasing intensity and a large duration depending on the number
      of contractions per spurt. The multiple pattern occurred in 34.2% (41/120) of
      patients at 2.7 +/- 0.1 days of post-partum and increased to 84.3% (59/70) at
      34.5 +/- 1.2 days. Accordingly, duration and the area under contraction curves
      increased throughout lactation. Mammary gland sensitivity to exogenous oxytocin
      (OT) did not change during the 2 months studies. SA was significantly greater in 
      full nursing mothers than in the partially nursing ones. The existence of a
      system for milk-ejection different from baby's suckling was further described. A 
      neuroendocrine mechanism and the release of increasing amounts of OT are
      suggested as important factors in the control of this phenomenon.

      Group on Drug Use in Pregnancy (C.G.D.U.P.).
PG  - 185-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the current situation in pregnancy drug prescription across 
      various cultural and health care settings. METHOD: An international study was set
      up to collect by questionnaire survey comparable data. A total of 14,778 women
      giving birth in 148 hospitals from 22 countries were enrolled. RESULT:
      Antenatally, 14% of women received no drugs, while drug takers received an
      average of 2.9 prescriptions. There were marked intercountry variations in
      prescribing habits. The majority of prescriptions referred to iron and vitamins. 
      Anti-infectives were the second most widely taken drugs. Anti-inflammatory drugs 
      were taken by 17% of women, these in 42% of cases being self-administered. During
      the intrapartum period 79% of the women received an average of 3.3 drugs. Besides
      analgesics/anesthetics (31.8%), the most commonly prescribed drugs were oxytocin 
      (17.5%), ergot derivatives (8.4%) and anti-infectives (5.3%). At the time of
      interview 91% of women were planning to breastfeed. Methylergometrin led the list
      of most frequently used drugs (36%) given to breastfeeding women, although the
      use of ergot derivatives in the puerperium showed wide intercountry variations.
      CONCLUSION: The survey has confirmed that at present, some drugs are often more
      widely used in pregnancy than is justified by the knowledge available.

TI  - Gonadotropin-releasing hormone specific binding sites in normal and malignant
      renal tissue.
PG  - 1568-70
AB  - Renal cell carcinoma has been reported to contain estrogen and progesterone
      receptors. Thus, it has been suggested that these tumors are hormone dependent in
      a similar manner described for the breast and prostate cancers. It has been
      recently shown that mammary and prostate tumor cells contain
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors and are growth inhibited directly
      by GnRH antagonists. In this study we examined for the presence of GnRH, estrogen
      and progesterone receptors in normal and malignant renal tissues. Estrogen
      receptors were found both in the normal and malignant kidney while progesterone
      receptors were present only in the normal tissue. Specific binding of
      [125I]buserelin, a GnRH agonist, was evident in renal carcinoma and in normal
      kidney and was displaced with equal efficiency by unlabeled buserelin and by
      D-Trp6-GnRH, but not by unrelated peptides such as thyrotropin releasing hormone 
      and oxytocin. The non-linear scatchard curve obtained for buserelin binding,
      suggests the presence of at least two binding sites, one with high affinity in
      the nanomolar range and another in the micromolar range.

OAB - Breast feeding can serve as a contraceptive up to 6 months after birth with 98%
      effectiveness. The so-called suckling reflex arc is a sensitive mechanism
      conveying messages about nutritional needs of the child, stimulating the release 
      of prolactin responsible for milk production, suppressing ovarian activity by
      hypothalamic beta-endorphin production leading to reduction in the pulsatile
      release of gonadotrophic hormones. Increased suckling produces more milk, but
      only in well-fed women. In Bangladesh, malnourished children required more
      suckling time than better-fed infants. Increasing the amounts of weaning food
      lowers feed urgency and suckling intensity thereby relaxing ovarian suppression. 
      Breast-milk consumption can be measured by test weighing the infant before and
      after feeding, but it is subject to error, especially in developing countries
      where up to 20 feeds are required to deliver 800 ml of milk. Thus, weighing over 
      2-5 days is more accurate. The method of giving deuterium oxide tracer to the
      mother, and measuring its disappearance from the mother's milk and the infant's
      saliva for 2 weeks is precise and noninvasive. The Doppler ultrasound technique
      measures milk flow through an artificial teat for research purposes. Manual or
      mechanical pump measurement of milk transfer separates the mother from the child,
      thus it is not useful for normal conditions. It can be used for estimating the
      amount of milk left and the rate of milk secretion by using a breast pump along
      with oxytocin for full emptying of milk. Accurate estimation of suckling
      intensity and milk transfer is essential for the determination of the
      relationship of breast feeding and lactational infecundity.

      stimulation to induce contraction stress test (CST), except where
      contraindicated. If CST was nonqualifying (less than three contractions per ten
      minutes), Pitocin (oxytocin) was used to complete the CST if there was a
      nonreactive NST. Delivery was instituted for any abnormal CST, even with a
      reactive NST, based on the last test within seven days of delivery. There were
      747 reactive NST and 72 nonreactive NST. Breast stimulation for CST was done in
      655 instances--315 (48 per cent) had nonqualifying CST and 340 (52 per cent) had 
      qualifying CST. There was an increased incidence of induction in the
      nonqualifying CST group and abnormal CST group. There were no statistically
      significant differences in perinatal outcomes in the group with reactive NST,
      irrespective of the CST result. There were no antepartum fetal deaths.

PG  - 726-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the use of drugs during breast feeding is scarce and
      rather anecdotal. The aim of this study was to gain knowledge on this issue in
      Spain. METHODS: The Spanish study on drug use in pregnancy recorded information
      on the use of drugs among 1,371 participating women, who delivered in 20
      hospitals of 15 cities. RESULTS: When approached for interview, 157 women (11%)
      had opted for artificial lactation. Among those women practicing maternal
      lactation at the time of the interview (n = 921), the total number of drug
      exposures after delivery was 1,270 (mean = 1.38; SD = 1.55; range 0-10); as many 
      medicines contained more than one drug, the total number of recorded drug
      exposures was 2,139. The most frequent indications for the use of these drugs
      were postpartum haemorrhage, pain and anti-infective prophylaxis, and the most
      consumed drugs were methylergometrine, metamizol, oxytocin, and amoxycillin.
      CONCLUSIONS: Women practicing maternal lactation frequently receive some drugs
      for which the information on their passage to maternal milk and on their safety
      for the newborn is not available.

TI  - Structure and expression of a human oxytocin receptor.
PG  - 526-9
AB  - Just before the onset of labour, uterine myometrium becomes extremely sensitive
      to oxytocin, for which it is a primary target tissue, because of a dramatic
      increase in the number of oxytocin receptors. We report here the structure and
      expression of the human oxytocin receptor complementary DNA isolated by
      expression cloning. The encoded receptor is a 388-amino-acid polypeptide with 7
      transmembrane domains typical of G protein-coupled receptors. The oxytocin
      receptor, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, specifically responds to oxytocin and
      induces an inward membrane current. Messenger RNAs for the receptor are of two
      sizes, 3.6 kilobases in breast, and 4.4 kilobases in ovary, uterine endometrium
      and myometrium. The mRNA level in the myometrium is very high at term. We
      conclude that the increase in receptor number in the myometrium at labour is, at 
      least in part, due to the increase in mRNA.

TI  - Evaluation of two methods employed for cervical ripening.
PG  - 58-9
AB  - The study evaluates breast stimulation and oxytocin infusion as methods for
      cervical ripening in patients where an obstetric indication for induction of
      labour exists. Forty patients with a Bishop score of 5 or 6 were randomly
      selected for either breast stimulation or oxytocin infusion. In a similar group
      of 20 cases, no method was employed. The Bishop score improved in 41.2% of cases 
      where breast stimulation was used as compared to 75% where an oxytocin infusion
      was given. Three foetal deaths in the breast stimulation group brought the study 
      to a stop after 17 cases. Cervical ripening with an oxytocin infusion drip
      appears to be a better method since infusion dosage can be precisely controlled
      making the technique more predictable and reliable. Though breast stimulation is 
      effective in ripening the cervix, it may be used only in cases of intrauterine
      foetal death as it may otherwise adversely affect foetal outcome.

TI  - Acute prolactin and oxytocin responses and milk yield to infant suckling and
      artificial methods of expression in lactating women.
PG  - 437-40
AB  - Breast-feeding is today the major form of infant nutrition in the immediate
      postpartum period. Despite this, recent trends in modern life-styles have raised 
      obstacles to successful lactation. These include infant illness and maternal
      responsibilities outside the home, both requiring separation from the mother.
      While the hormonal dynamics of infant suckling are understood, little is known
      about the effects of artificial methods of milk expression. A variety of breast
      pumps exist in the current US market which vary considerably in price and
      effectiveness. To understand better the ability of these pumps to assist women in
      the maintenance of lactation, the current study was undertaken to evaluate their 
      effects on milk yield and prolactin and oxytocin release when compared to natural
      infant suckling. Twenty-three women who were exclusively breast-feeding their
      infants were randomly assigned to serially use several pumping methods, as well
      as infant suckling, with blood being taken at 10-minute intervals to determine
      the hormonal responses. The results reveal variability in the prolactin responses
      to the artificial pumping methods, with the greatest responses found with an
      electric pulsatile pump; these responses compare favorably with those of natural 
      infant suckling. Other methods were less successful in causing prolactin
      elevations. No differences were seen among the methods in the oxytocin response. 
      The results of this study demonstrate striking differences in the ability of
      breast-pumping methods to produce an acute and sustained prolactin rise in
      breast-feeding mothers. The large discrepancies found suggest the need for
      further studies in to enable women and health care providers to choose the most
      appropriate method for milk expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Inhibition by ethanol of the oxytocin response to breast stimulation in normal
      women and the role of endogenous opioids.
PG  - 213-6
AB  - The possible inhibition exerted by ethanol on the oxytocin response to breast
      stimulation was tested in normal women. The possible role of endogenous opioids
      in the control of the oxytocin response to breast stimulation and/or ethanol
      action was also examined. Sixteen normal women were tested four times on the 22nd
      day of four consecutive regular menstrual cycles. All women underwent mechanical 
      breast stimulation (for 10 min) with the concomitant administration of normal
      saline, naloxone (2 or 4 mg in an iv bolus plus 5 or 10 mg over 16 min), ethanol 
      (50 ml in 110 ml of whisky po) or the combination of ethanol and naloxone. Plasma
      oxytocin levels rose about twofold after breast stimulation, with a mean peak
      response at 10 min. The oxytocin response to breast stimulation was not changed
      by the treatment with the lower (2 plus 5 mg) or the higher (4 plus 10 mg) dose
      of naloxone, whereas it was completely abolished by ethanol. However, when
      ethanol was given together with naloxone, the oxytocin rise induced by breast
      stimulation was only partially inhibited by ethanol (the mean oxytocin peak was
      50% higher than baseline). At both doses naloxone produced similar effects. These
      data demonstrate that ethanol inhibits the oxytocin response to breast
      stimulation. Naloxone sensitive endogenous opioids do not appear to be involved
      in the control of the oxytocin rise induced by breast stimulation. In contrast,
      since naloxone partially reversed the inhibiting effects of ethanol, a partial
      involvement of opioid peptides in ethanol action is supposed.

TI  - Thyroid hormone regulates the oxytocin gene.
PG  - 3771-7
AB  - Endocrine factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the oxytocin (OT)
      gene were investigated in heterologous expression systems. Plasmids having a
      5'-flanking region of the rat OT gene (-363/+16) or the human OT gene (-382/+41) 
      cloned in front of the firefly luciferase gene were co-transfected with an
      expression vector for the rat thyroid hormone receptor alpha in P19 embryonal
      carcinoma (EC) cells. Thyroid hormone (T3) stimulated the activity of the rat and
      human OT promoters about 10-fold. In MCF-7 breast tumor cells transfected with
      the human OT promoter-luciferase fusion gene, T3 stimulation through endogenous
      thyroid hormone receptors was about 5-fold. Co-transfection experiments in P19EC 
      cells using 5' deletion mutants of the rat OT gene showed that thyroid hormone
      responsiveness was located in two regions, one located between nucleotides -195
      and -172, the other between nucleotides -172 and -148. Each region accounted for 
      about 3-fold T3 stimulation. Gel retardation analysis using extracts from HeLa
      cells over-producing the c-erbA/TR alpha protein showed specific binding to the
      -172/-148 element, while no binding occurred on the -195/-172 element. The
      -172/-148 element which contains the imperfect estrogen response element,
      GGTGACCTTGACC, has inverted as well as direct repeats of the TGACC motif.
      Mutagenesis of TGACC motifs separately reduced thyroid hormone responsiveness by 
      about 50%. However, simultaneous mutation of two TGACC motifs abolished the
      responsiveness to T3 completely. There was no cooperativity between the activated
      thyroid hormone and estrogen receptors in transfected MCF-7 cells nor in thyroid 
      hormone receptor and estrogen receptor co-transfected P19EC cells. Negative
      interactions between these two receptors were observed and gel retardation assays
      showed interaction between the two receptors proteins. It was shown in an in vivo
      experiment that treatment of rats with thyroid hormone increased hypothalamic OT 
      mRNA levels, the pituitary OT content, as well as OT levels in blood. The results
      reveal thyroid hormone as a physiological regulator of OT gene expression, which 
      stimulates OT promoter activity directly through interaction with a thyroid
      hormone-response element in the OT gene.

TI  - Clinical and biological significance of HSP89 alpha in human breast cancer.
PG  - 409-15
AB  - In order to isolate and characterize genes whose expression may be altered in
      breast malignancy, we screened a cDNA library with a polyclonal anti-serum
      against breast-cancer-metastasis membranes and isolated several immunopositive
      clones. One of these, AJ1, was analyzed in detail and found to be expressed at
      varying levels as a 3.3-kb mRNA in all of 143 breast cancers. High expression was
      associated with lymph-node involvement (p = 0.03). Comparison between high- and
      low-expressing groups showed a significant difference at 4 and 6 years for both
      overall (p = 0.004 and p = 0.002 respectively) and disease-free (p = 0.0001 and p
      = 0.04 respectively) survival, but not at 11 years. AJ1 was expressed at much
      lower levels in non-malignant biopsies as compared with malignant tissue (p =
      0.001). Expression was observed in breast-cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75-1, T47D,
      MDA-MB-231 and HBL 100. Partial sequence analysis of the 620 bp clone showed
      complete homology with human heat-shock protein 89 alpha. In addition to being
      heat-inducible in all the breast cell lines examined, AJ1 levels were increased
      by estradiol (blocked by cyclohexamide and tamoxifen), EGF, oxytocin and
      vasopressin in a time-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells and by estradiol, EGF,
      prolactin and hydrocortisone in T47D cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, EGF caused
      down-regulation of AJ1 mRNA levels. The increasing evidence for the association
      of heat-shock proteins with steroid receptors suggests that AJ1 may play an
      important role in the control of estrogen-receptor transcriptional activity in
      breast cancers.

AB  - Damage to the breast epithelium by chemical carcinogens as products of oxygen
      free radical release can lead to fibroblast proliferation, hyperplasia of
      epithelium, cellular atypia and breast cancer. Chemical carcinogens may
      accumulate in breast fluid in the non-lactating breast consequent to superoxide
      free radical production which occurs via the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
      hypoxanthine pathway. This pathway is initiated by hypoxia of local tissue. Under
      hypoxic conditions ATP is broken down to form hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine itself
      is broken down to produce xanthine and then uric acid. This results in the
      production of superoxide free radicals, the products of which are carcinogenic.
      The development of localized hypoxia, which is central to this hypothesis, is
      caused by acinal gland distention from fluid secreted by raised prolactin levels 
      in the absence of oxytocin. Stimulation of the nipple in a non-lactating breast
      may raise plasma oxytocin and lower plasma prolactin levels. Contraction of the
      myoepithelial cells of the breast under the influence of oxytocin would relieve
      distention of the acinal glands and thus reduce hypoxia and the generation of
      lipid peroxidoses as products of free radical damage. The epidemiology of breast 
      fibrosis and cancer support the notion that lack of nipple stimulation over time 
      may be a significant variable. A review of this literature linked with current
      biochemical work on fibrosis and carcinogenesis suggest that draining the breasts
      of the products of superoxide free-radical release by the encouragement of
      regular nipple erections may prevent such breast disease.

      endometrial carcinomata.
PG  - 135-42
AB  - Specific low-affinity high-capacity binding sites for gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone (GnRH) have recently been discovered in human breast and ovarian
      carcinomata. We checked whether similar binding sites are present in human
      endometrial cancer. Plasma membrane preparations were incubated with
      [125I,D-Ala6-desGly10]-GnRH-ethylamide in the presence or absence of unlabelled
      GnRH agonists or other peptides. GnRH-binding could be demonstrated in all 12
      tumor samples tested. The mathematical analysis of the binding data was
      consistent with a single class of low affinity (Ka = (0.8-1.4) x 10(5) M-1) and
      high-capacity (Bmax = (134-142) x 10(-12) M/mg membrane protein) binding sites.
      Native GnRH had a similar affinity to the binding sites as the GnRH agonist used.
      Other peptides such as oxytocin, somatostatin and thyrotropin-releasing hormone
      did not crossreact with the binding sites. A photolabelled derivative of
      [D-Lys6]-GnRH was prepared with the bifunctional photolabile reagent
      (4-azidobenzyl)-N-hydroxysuccinimide. Photoaffinity labelling of endometrial
      carcinoma membranes and subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in 10% 
      polyacrylamide gel revealed the presence of a single molecular mass component of 
      62 +/- 1.9 kDa. The appearance of this photolabelled binding site could be
      largely suppressed by the addition of unlabelled GnRH-agonist (10(-4) M) and thus
      represents the specific binding site for GnRH in endometrial cancer.

TI  - Breast feeding practices and severe hyperbilirubinaemia.
PG  - 240-4
AB  - This study establishes the association between early onset severe
      hyperbilirubinaemia (serum bilirubin (SBR) level greater than or equal to 272
      mumol/L) with no assigned cause and breast feeding. The rates of breast feeding
      at hospital discharge increased from 46.4 to 75.4% in non-insured (public) women 
      and 58.6 to 89.2% in insured (private) women between 1975 and 1987, and were
      accompanied by an increase in severe hyperbilirubinaemia from 1.6 to 3.1% in
      public and 0.9 to 3.6% in private babies. The case control study involved 125
      term breast feeding infants born between 1 July 1985 and 1 July 1986 with severe 
      hyperbilirubinaemia (SBR level 272 mumol/L) with no assigned cause who were
      compared with 125 matched controls who had peak SBR levels less than or equal to 
      272 mumol/L. Severe hyperbilirubinaemia was associated with primiparous and
      non-Caucasian mothers, non-smoking and oxytocin usage. Univariate analysis of
      feeding practice variables revealed that less frequent breast feeds, greater
      weight loss and less frequent stools over the first 3 days related to severe
      hyperbilirubinaemia (P less than 0.05). Multivariate analysis of the eight
      significant univariate factors revealed that maternal non-smoking, less frequent 
      breast feeding, less frequent stooling and excessive infant weight loss were the 
      best predictors of severe hyperbilirubinaemia. With the wide promotion of breast 
      feeding, the contribution of individual feeding practices to severe
      hyperbilirubinaemia demands ongoing analysis and review.

TI  - Comparison of the estrogen responsiveness of the rat and bovine oxytocin gene
      promoters.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - DNA sequences in the 5'-flanking region of rat and bovine oxytocin genes were
      examined for their capacity to confer estrogen responsiveness to their homologous
      promoters. In contrast to the 5'-flanking region of the rat oxytocin gene,
      upstream promoter sequences up to 3200 bp of the bovine gene linked to the
      chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene which were transfected in
      estrogen receptor expressing MCF-7 cells did not respond to estrogen. Testing
      5'-deletion mutants of the rat upstream region linked to the luciferase gene in
      P19 embryocarcinoma cells co-transfected with an estrogen receptor expression
      plasmid showed that two regions each associated with approximately 15-fold
      stimulation of promoter activity were located between nucleotides -172 and -149
      and between -148 and +16 in the rat gene. The former region contains the
      imperfect palindrome GGTGACCTTGACC which differs in one nucleotide from the
      estrogen response element (ERE) consensus. It is concluded that the corresponding
      motive CATAACCTTGACC of the bovine gene is not a functional ERE. Thus, the
      estrogen responsiveness of oxytocin genes is species-dependent.

TI  - [Significance in unilateral intermittent breast stimulation in prenatal
      diagnosis].
PG  - 417-9
AB  - 50 intermittent, unilateral breast stimulation test were studied, which were
      registered not more than 7 days before labour. The authors wanted to know how
      informative this method is to the fetal state, how much time it takes and which
      are the most common side effects. This method was compared with a previously by
      the authors publicated unilateral, continuous breast stimulation test. It is
      concluded that the intermittent, unilateral breast stimulation test well
      indicates the fetal state, though it takes more time, but no hyperstimulation was
      found in this study. The authors suggest to choose this unilateral, breast
      stimulation test as a first step because of its simplicity and shortness and
      cheapness. Only in case of unsuccess the next choice should be the intravenous
      oxytocin challenge test.

TI  - Lipoprotein lipase in human milk: compartmentalization and effect of fasting,
      insulin, and glucose.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - The object of this study was to investigate the effect of maternal metabolic
      state on the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in human milk. Although the
      total LPL activity in milk was not significantly affected by up to three cycles
      of freezing and thawing, the amount of LPL associated with the cream fraction of 
      the milk increased from an average of less than 10% to about 70% after this
      treatment. The enzyme was relatively stable when the milk was stored on ice,
      losing activity at a rate of about 1% per hour. At 37 degrees C degradation was
      more rapid, about 7% per hour. When LPL activity was measured in samples taken at
      hourly intervals by breast pump, using oxytocin to achieve a complete letdown at 
      each pumping, activity was found to double from the first to the third pumping.
      Thereafter the activity was stable under fasting conditions. Hyperglycemic and
      euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp protocols were used to evaluate the
      effects of glucose and insulin. Both high plasma glucose and high plasma insulin 
      in the presence of normal glucose significantly increased LPL activity within 4
      hours. We conclude that, like adipose, tissue LPL, mammary LPL is regulated by
      plasma insulin.

TI  - [Continuous breast stimulation in prenatal fetal diagnosis].
PG  - 15-7
AB  - Fifty, high risk pregnancies were studied, where not more than 7 days before
      labour passed, an unilateral continuous breast stimulation test was performed.
      The predictive value, the testing time and the side effects of the method were
      analyzed. According to the results this breast stimulation test reliably
      indicates the fetal state. The testing time of the endogenous oxytocin challenge 
      test is shorter than that of the exogen oxytocin challenge test. Because of the
      risk of hyperstimulation the test must be performed with intensive maternal and
      fetal observation. In the opinion of the authors the breast stimulation
      test--because of its reliability, shorter testing time and simpleness--should be 
      the first choice among the challenge tests and only in case of a failure comes an
      exogen oxytocin challenge test into question.

      during pregnancy with the same tendency during medication with o.c. Gastrin
      levels were unaffected during the peripartal period and during medication with

      concentrations of oxytocin and lower somatostatin concentrations post-prandially 
      during pregnancy and fasting at 3 months after delivery compared with
      non-breastfeeders at 3 months after delivery. Metabolic and behavioral
      implications are discussed.

PG  - 119-23
AB  - Oxytocin (OT) administration has been shown to inhibit adrenocorticotropic
      hormone (ACTH)/cortisol secretion in several experimental conditions. In the
      present study, the plasma OT responses to suckling in 7 lactating women or to
      mechanical breast stimulation in 6 normally menstruating women (experimental
      tests) or to sham stimuli in the same subjects (control tests) were measured and 
      correlated with the simultaneous changes in plasma ACTH/cortisol levels. All
      women showed similar basal levels of OT, ACTH and cortisol, which remained
      unmodified after sham stimulation. In contrast, both suckling and breast
      stimulation produced a significant increase in plasma OT levels and a significant
      decrease in plasma ACTH concentrations. When OT and ACTH data were considered
      together, a significant negative correlation was found between the OT increase
      and the simultaneous ACTH decline. Plasma cortisol levels were lower during
      suckling or breast stimulation than in control conditions. These data show an
      inverse relationship between plasma OT and ACTH levels during suckling and breast
      stimulation in humans, suggesting an inhibitory influence of OT on ACTH/cortisol 
      secretion in a physiological condition.

TI  - Interaction of vasopressin and oxytocin with human breast carcinoma cells.
PG  - 7882-6
AB  - The arginine vasopressin and oxytocin content of normal and cancerous human
      breast tissue were measured using radioimmunoassay. Both peptides were present in
      amounts greater than that found in the circulation, but no difference between
      normal and malignant tissues was found. Binding of [3H]oxytocin and
      [3H]vasopressin were characterized in human breast carcinoma cells (MCF7 cells). 
      Binding of both hormones to MCF7 cells was specific and saturable, the
      vasopressin receptor found to be of the V1 subtype. Scatchard analyses of the
      data were linear, indicating a single high affinity, low capacity binding site
      for each hormone (vasopressin: KD = 47.4 +/- 1.6 nmol/liter, Bmax = 27,300 +/-
      6,500 sites/cell; oxytocin: KD = 51.3 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter, Bmax = 87,000 +/- 4,000
      sites/cell). The effects of vasopressin and oxytocin on the growth of MCF7 cells 
      were assessed using protein accumulation and cell numbers. Vasopressin at 10-1000
      pmol/liter was mitogenic for MCF7 cells, but higher doses (10 nmol/liter) were
      growth inhibitory. Oxytocin was also mitogenic for MCF7 cells but to a lesser
      extent than vasopressin. In conclusion, we suggest that vasopressin and possibly 
      oxytocin may be important modulators of the growth of some human breast
      carcinomas.

PG  - 81-6
AB  - We have investigated the role of endogenous opioid peptides in the release of
      oxytocin (OT) in response to breast feeding and breast stimulation in humans.
      Five breast feeding women were studied on two separate occasions within 4 weeks
      of delivery. Saline or naloxone, 4 mg bolus and 6 mg/h, was administered
      intravenously, in random order. Blood samples were taken at regular intervals. In
      the saline-infused group OT rose from a baseline of 1.1 +/- 0.1 pmol/l (mean +/- 
      SEM) to a peak of 7.0 +/- 0.9 after 6 min, and in the naloxone-infused group from
      1.0 +/- 0.1 pmol/l to 5.8 +/- 1.3 (P less than 0.05). There were no significant
      differences between the two groups at any time point. Plasma vasopressin (AVP)
      did not change. In the second study six women in the luteal phase of the
      menstrual cycle were investigated on two occasions at least 48 h apart. They were
      similarly infused with either naloxone or saline in random sequence. A mechanical
      breast pump provided breast stimulation. In saline-infused women OT levels rose
      from a baseline of 1.0 +/- 0.1 pmol/l (mean +/- SEM) to a peak of 3.0 +/- 1.1 (P 
      less than 0.05) after 6 min, and in naloxone infused women from 1.1 +/- 0.1
      pmol/l to 3.0 +/- 1.4 (NS). There were no differences in OT between the groups.
      AVP did not change. We conclude that endogenous opioid peptides do not modulate
      OT release during breast feeding or breast stimulation in women.

TI  - [Experiences with breast stimulation for labor induction].
PG  - 569-71
AB  - At the Gynaecological Department of the University of Innsbruck, 207 nipple
      stimulation for the induction of uterine contractions were performed, using the
      necessary precautions, in 186 pregnant women at term. The continuous or
      intermittent manual stimulation by the patient was mainly used for contraction
      stress testing. An adequate uterine response (at least 3 contractions per 10
      minutes) was achieved in 57%. Reversible signs of hyperstimulation, such as
      prolonged uterine contractions and tachysystoles, were observed in 10%, causing
      reversible pathologic fetal heart rate patterns in 1%. The classical intravenous 
      oxytocin challenge test produced a higher uterine response rate as compared at
      the same time to breast stimulation. Provided, that an adequate response was
      achieved, normal and pathological fetal reaction patterns were identical in both 
      tests. In 20 patients we used nipple electrostimulation. Results were similar to 
      those achieved by manual stimulation. Due to the conflicting reports in the
      literature and because of the potential hazards involved, the use of nipple
      stimulation for the induction of uterine contractions can be advocated only in a 
      controlled clinical setting. Its application without medical supervision, as
      propagated in the lay press, is definitely contraindicated.

PG  - 710-4
AB  - A randomized, prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of nipple
      stimulation with a breast pump as compared to oxytocin for augmentation of labor.
      The average and maximal uterine activity achieved was significantly higher in the
      oxytocin-stimulated group, without significant differences in the length of labor
      stages, cesarean section rate, Apgar scores or umbilical artery pH. Fifty percent
      of the patients failed to respond to nipple stimulation after 30 minutes and were
      switched to oxytocin. These patients experienced a more rapid rate of cervical
      dilation in the active phase and reached higher maximal uterine activity with
      oxytocin stimulation; however, the cesarean section rate was highest in this
      group. Nipple stimulation with a breast pump appears to be a safe and effective
      alternative to oxytocin for the augmentation of labor.

TI  - Physiology of lactation.
PG  - 379-95
AB  - The development of the human breast is dependent on the presence of ovarian
      steroids. The basic secretory units--the alveoli--continue to respond to steroids
      throughout the reproductive years. Lactogenesis is triggered by a rapid and
      drastic fall in progesterone at delivery and maintained by prolactin while the
      actual expulsion of milk from the breast depends on oxytocin. The composition of 
      milk is very variable but is adequate to provide the sole source of nutrients for
      up to the first 6 months of life. Lactation suppresses ovarian activity probably 
      through a disturbance in the pulsatile pattern of LH secretion but the degree of 
      suppression depends on infant feeding patterns and perhaps on maternal
      nutritional status. Breastfeeding therefore confers a degree of protection
      against pregnancy but some artificial methods of contraception are appropriate
      for use during lactation. It is still not clear whether breastfeeding protects
      significantly against breast cancer.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate peripartal performance on
      cognitive tests and its possible relationship with plasma oxytocin
      concentrations. Twenty women (cases) were tested on five experimental occasions, 
      the first toward the end of pregnancy and the last 12 months postpartum. On each 
      experimental occasion performance on cognitive tests of memory and attention was 
      recorded and oxytocin concentrations were simultaneously assayed in
      plasma-samples. Twenty non-pregnant women (controls) were investigated at similar
      intervals. Cases were found to have improved their performance on some cognitive 
      tests significantly more than controls when results at 6 and 12 months after
      delivery were compared with those from the end of pregnancy and up to three
      months after partus. This observation strongly suggests impairment in cognitive
      performance during the peripartal period. Cases had significantly higher oxytocin
      concentrations than controls in plasma samples up to three months post partum. No
      correlation was, however, found between cognitive test results and levels of
      oxytocin concentration.

PG  - 301-6
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine suckling-related plasma levels of
      oxytocin and prolactin in early and established lactation and to correlate
      hormone profiles to success of lactation performance. Fifty-five primiparous
      women participated in the study. From each, 18 blood samples were drawn in
      connection with breast-feeding on day 4 post partum and after 3-4 months.
      Oxytocin and prolactin levels were determined with radio-immunoassay. Basal
      levels of both hormones were significantly higher 4 days post partum than 3-4
      months later and after weaning. Basal prolactin levels fell significantly within 
      24 h of weaning. Oxytocin and prolactin levels rose in response to
      breast-feeding--an effect which persisted during the lactation period. The
      suckling-induced release of prolactin--but not that of oxytocin--was related to
      basal hormone levels. Basal as well as stimulated oxytocin levels obtained 4 days
      and 3-4 months post partum correlated significantly, indicating that each woman
      has an individual, characteristic level of this hormone. Milk yield did not
      correlate with oxytocin or prolactin levels, but prolactin levels recorded 3-4
      months post partum did correlate with the remaining period of breast-feeding. In 
      addition, mothers who breast-fed exclusively 3-4 months post partum had
      significantly higher oxytocin and prolactin levels than those who gave
      supplementary feed. There was a significant correlation between oxytocin levels
      at 4 days and birth weight of the infant.

TI  - Comparison of the nipple stimulation and exogenous oxytocin contraction stress
      tests. A randomized, prospective study.
PG  - 950-4
AB  - In a prospective, randomized trial, 103 women underwent a total of 203 antenatal 
      stress tests. One hundred four nipple stimulation contraction stress tests (BSTs)
      and 99 oxytocin challenge tests (OCTs) were performed. The patient populations
      were similar for the two groups. Uterine hyperstimulation with abnormal fetal
      heart rate patterns occurred with 2.9% and 1% of the BSTs and OCTs, respectively.
      The failure rate for the BST group was 22%. Maternal age and weight, parity and
      gestational age were not associated with test failure. Only one patient failed
      more than one BST, but she did not fail every such test. When test time (time
      from initiation to completion of the test) was compared between the two groups, a
      significant difference was found when the BST was successful. However, when test 
      time in the total BST group (successful and unsuccessful BSTs followed by an OCT 
      was compared to that in the OCT group, no difference could be found. Though an
      OCT following an unsuccessful BST took longer to perform than did a primary OCT, 
      the difference was not statistically significant. It appears that BST test
      failure may relate more to the technique of nipple stimulation used than to
      intrinsic patient factors.

TI  - [Drugs for the mother and infant in the maternity ward. A study of 5 Norwegian
      university hospitals].
PG  - 2118-22
AB  - Hospital records were used to record, all drugs prescribed in the maternity ward,
      delivery characteristics and complications in both mother and infant at five
      university hospitals. The retrospective survey comprised 970 women and
      represented 10% of all vaginal deliveries in these hospitals in 1980, and 2% of
      all annual births in Norway. In total 90% of the women received drugs, excluding 
      laxatives, oxytocics and long-term medication, vitamins and iron. Large
      variations were found between hospitals in respect of hypnotics (41-86%) and
      analgesics (65-95%). Of newborns 4-23% were treated with a drug. The large
      variation was largely due to frequent administration of naloxone at one of the
      hospitals. Drug utilization post partum was significantly higher in primipareas
      and in mothers who underwent interventions such as epidural anaesthesia, oxytocin
      drip, forceps delivery and tears. 98% of the babies were breast-fed on discharge 
      and thus received milk potentially containing drugs. The frequent use of
      hypnotics indicates that breast-feeding mothers were treated like hospital
      patients in general. For the majority of the drugs used as a routine in the
      maternity wards there was no data or insufficient data on excretion in breast
      milk. The large discrepancy between hospitals as regards prescription of
      hypnotics and oxytocics to the mother and naloxone to the newborn was considered 
      not to reflect rational prescription criteria and should therefore be reassessed.

PG  - 283-7
AB  - The purpose of this research was to prospectively study the variables
      contributing to the variance in third-day bilirubin levels in healthy, full-term 
      newborns. The study subjects were 252 full-term, healthy infants born at the
      University of Kansas Medical Center over a four-month period. Using a multiple
      stepwise regression analysis, six factors were found to be significant predictors
      of higher third-day bilirubin levels: higher cord bilirubin level; lower total
      serum protein in the infant on admission to the nursery; sex of the child;
      administration of promethazine hydrochloride during labor; greater weight loss in
      the infant; and breast-feeding. Several other factors which have been implicated 
      previously--including use of oxytocin for induction or augmentation of labor,
      previous use of birth control pills by the mother, prolonged rupture of membranes
      prior to delivery, type of delivery, race, and epidural anesthesia--were not
      found to be significant predictors of third-day bilirubin levels once the six
      variables listed had been taken into consideration. The results are discussed in 
      terms of past research as well as implications for clinical practice.

TI  - Acute administration of lithium carbonate interferes with suckling in neonatal
      rats.
PG  - 453-8
AB  - These studies provide an animal model for the lithium-induced decrease in
      suckling reported in the clinical literature that allows for more precise
      determination of causal mechanisms. Nine-day-old rat pups were administered
      lithium carbonate via either intraperitoneal (IP) injections or intragastric (IG)
      gavage in doses approximating that which human infants might receive via breast
      milk. The pups were tested for their ability to locate and attach to the nipples 
      of an anesthetized dam. Lithium significantly increased the pups' latency to
      attach to a nipple. Further tests of milk extraction using oxytocin-induced
      milk-letdowns indicate that lithium also interferes with milk withdrawal. Tests
      of motor and sensory deficits using an open-field and an olfactory choice test
      indicated that lithium did not similarly impair these behavioral facets of
      suckling. Alternative mechanisms for lithium-produced suppression of suckling are
      discussed.

      7.90 +/- 0.20 mg/dl observed at 64.0 +/- 1.3 h of life. Three factors were found 
      to significantly alter the course of hyperbilirubinemia: first and second
      bilirubin determinations (at 2 to 4 h and 12 to 24 h, respectively), weight loss 
      and male sex. Increased weight loss was positively correlated with
      hyperbilirubinemia irrespective of the mode of feeding.

AB  - The effect of nipple stimulation on uterine activity, foetal heart rate and
      plasma oxytocin level in healthy full term pregnant women was studied. Ten women 
      in weeks 38-39 of pregnancy stimulated their nipples for 30 min. Nine of the ten 
      experienced uterine contractions. One woman showed signs uterine hyperactivity
      (frequent contractions) and foetal heart rate decelerations. Blood samples were
      drawn at 15 s intervals during 5-6 contractions and oxytocin levels were measured
      with radioimmunoassay. Oxytocin levels rose significantly during the nipple
      stimulation and short bursts of oxytocin were recorded during contractions.
      Nipple stimulation has been used to induce labour and our data may suggest that
      oxytocin released in response to such stimulation is responsible for the
      contractions induced.

TI  - Breast-feeding following spontaneous and induced labour.
PG  - 275-9
AB  - Carrying out the intention to breast-feed was assessed in 185 mothers divided
      into four groups according to whether labour was spontaneous, with or without
      oxytocin augmentation, or induced, either by their own choice or on the advice of
      their obstetrician. Intention to breast-feed was abandoned most frequently by
      women in whom labour had been electively induced. As the difference with the
      other groups could not be explained by obstetric factors, it is concluded that
      motivational factors may have played a part.

TI  - Anti-progesterones in obstetrics, ectopic pregnancies and gynaecological
      malignancy.
PG  - 631-8
AB  - Table 2 summarizes the proven and potential uses of anti-progesterones in
      obstetrics and gynaecology. In addition to their role in the induction of
      menstruation and the interruption of first-trimester pregnancy,
      anti-progesterones can definitely accelerate cervical ripening and promote the
      termination of second-trimester pregnancy, especially in combination with
      exogenous prostaglandins. Furthermore, anti-progesterones can also initiate
      labour in the obstetric complication of fetal death in utero, leading to delivery
      of the fetus and placenta without additional medical treatment and without
      surgery in the majority of patients. The wider use of anti-progesterones for the 
      induction of labour, with or without other adjuvants such as oxytocin or
      prostaglandin analogues, is still uncertain and awaits further study.
      Anti-progesterones may also be useful in the medical treatment of early ectopic
      pregnancy, either alone or in combination with other medicines. Preliminary
      results indicate that progesterone receptor antagonists may also be useful both
      for the initiation and promotion of lactation as well as the possible management 
      of advanced breast cancer containing progesterone receptors. Finally, the
      usefulness of anti-progesterones in other gynaecological malignancies containing 
      progesterone receptors, such as endometrial or ovarian cancers, awaits further
      study.

TI  - Distribution of immunoreactive vasotocin and mesotocin in the chicken
      gastrointestinal tract.
PG  - 241-6
AB  - Immunoreactive arginine vasotocin (AVT) and mesotocin (MT) were measured in
      heart, breast muscle, adrenals, testes, and different parts of the
      gastrointestinal tract in adult male chickens. Neither of the peptides were
      detected in liver, testis, heart and breast muscle. The amounts of AVT and MT in 
      the adrenals were 167 +/- 25 and 669 +/- 198 pg/gland, respectively. Considerable
      amounts of immunoreactive peptides were found in the gastrointestinal tract with 
      the highest concentration in the proventriculus (4.18 +/- 0.31 ng AVT and 16.58
      +/- 0.86 ng MT per organ). Dose-response curves of duodenal and proventriculus
      extracts were parallel with synthetic AVT and MT standards.

TI  - Jaundice in the healthy newborn infant: a new approach to an old problem.
PG  - 505-11
AB  - We measured the serum bilirubin concentrations in 2,416 consecutive infants
      admitted to our well baby nursery. The maximal serum bilirubin concentration
      exceeded 12.9 mg/dL (221 mumol/L) in 147 infants (6.1%), and these infants were
      compared with 147 randomly selected control infants with maximal serum bilirubin 
      levels less than or equal to 12.9 mg/dL. A serum bilirubin concentration greater 
      than 12.9 mg/dL was associated strongly with breast-feeding (P = .0000) and
      percentage of weight loss after birth (P = .0001), as well as with maternal
      diabetes, oriental race, decreased gestational age, male sex, bruising, and
      induction of labor with oxytocin. Risk ratios and the risk of jaundice were
      calculated for hypothetical infants in the presence and absence of these
      variables. These calculations show that, in certain infants, "nonphysiologic"
      jaundice is likely to develop and its presence in such infants might not require 
      laboratory investigations. In others, a modest degree of hyperbilirubinemia could
      be cause for concern. An awareness of these factors and their potential
      contribution to serum bilirubin levels permits a more rational approach to the
      action levels used for the investigation of jaundice in the newborn. We need a
      new definition of physiologic jaundice.

OAB - Breast feeding provides an infant all its nutritional needs and therefore is the 
      best and most cost effective food for infants. In addition, antibodies in the
      breast milk protects the infant from gastrointestinal illnesses and some
      respiratory infections. Full breast feeding is also good for the mother because
      prolonged lactational amenorrhea will preserve hemoglobin stores and, for the 1st
      6 months, she is unable to conceive. Therefore breast feeding assists in the
      spacing of births, thereby reducing maternal and infant mortality. Infants born 2
      years after a preceding sibling are twice as likely to die as those born after an
      interval of 2 years. This risk changes little between countries, in spite of
      variabilities in fertility, infant mortality, and level of socioeconomic
      development. In Africa and Asia where women are likely to breast feed their
      children, breast feeding prevents an average of 4 births/woman. On the other
      hand, modern contraception has replaced breast feeding in Central and South
      America as the major way of regulating fertility. Even though the health benefits
      of breast feeding are known, most nations with family planning policies or
      targets for the reduction of infant mortality have no developed national policies
      regarding breast feeding. Regardless of the overall socioeconomic level of a
      nation, breast feeding should always be uppermost when formulating public health 
      policies and goals. In Africa and Asia, public policies should concentrate on
      maintaining or increasing traditional breast feeding practices. In the Americas, 
      however, the focus should be on the health benefits of breast feeding for the
      infants. The most effective and "safe for the baby" oral contraceptive for
      lactating women is the mini pill. IUDs have no effect on lactation or infant
      health.

TI  - The breast-stimulated contraction stress test.
PG  - 919-23
AB  - A method was developed for using breast stimulation to induce uterine
      contractions for a contraction stress test (BSCST). Six hundred fifty-seven
      patients made 1,484 attempts with the BSCST and were successful in 1,072 trials
      (72.2%). A lower success rate was observed only in gestations less than or equal 
      to 34 weeks. The distribution of test results (positive, negative, equivocal) by 
      BSCST was unchanged from that of contraction stress tests performed with
      exogenous oxytocin (oxytocin challenge test [OCT]). The incidence of
      false-positive tests was similar to that in previous reports. The corrected
      perinatal mortality rate for the study population was 1.5 per 1,000 births. The
      time required for an adequate uterine response was 23.8 +/- 15.2 minutes, with
      87.5% of patients responding in less than 30 minutes. The BSCST appears to be a
      reasonable alternative to the OCT, with elimination of the intravenous line and
      oxytocin administration and with a shorter testing time.

TI  - Breast stimulation test and oxytocin challenge test in fetal surveillance: a
      prospective randomized study.
PG  - 1178-81
AB  - Fifty healthy gravidas with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at a gestational 
      age of 35 to 42 weeks were assigned at random for the performance of either a
      breast stimulation test or an oxytocin challenge test after a nonreactive
      nonstress test. A satisfactory contraction stress test was achieved in 21 of 25
      women in the breast stimulation test group and in 24 of 25 women in the oxytocin 
      challenge test group (nonsignificant difference). Significant differences were
      found in the cumulative rate of achieved contraction stress tests: in the breast 
      stimulation test group 17 of 21 after 20 minutes and 21 of 21 at 50 minutes
      whereas in the oxytocin challenge test group only four of 24 at 20 minutes, eight
      of 24 at 50 minutes, and 21 of 24 at 150 minutes. The mean duration for the
      achievement of a contraction stress test was 20.9 +/- 11.5 minutes for the breast
      stimulation test group and 81.3 +/- 48.4 minutes in the oxytocin challenge test
      group. Uterine hyperstimulation occurred once in each group. No gravida went into
      labor within 24 hours. Breast stimulation test is a satisfactory alternative to
      the oxytocin challenge test, is less time-consuming, and is simpler to perform.

OAB - Research on successful breast feeding demonstrated the need for a supportive
      person who encourages the mother. A letdown reflex induced by the release of
      oxytocin can cause insufficient milk production, as can psychosocial factors
      (exhaustion, fear, stress). A South African organization formed mother support
      groups resulting in increased prevalence and duration of breast feeding. Work
      pressures, and sore nipples among women of low socioeconomic status cause early
      cessation of nursing. In 1984, a sister at the Retreat Midwife Obstetric Unit in 
      Cape Town involved mothers in a short course with great success. After discharge 
      they could contact a person for help and support to continue breast feeding. This
      program could serve as a model for other nurses. There is a need for breast
      feeding counselors, since women are increasingly involved in work while taking
      care of young children. Health services are unable to provide such postpartum
      assistance and encourage breast feeding.

TI  - A prospective comparative study of the extended nonstress test and the nipple
      stimulation contraction stress test.
PG  - 531-7
AB  - The nonstress test and the nipple stimulation contraction stress test were
      performed at the Medical College of Georgia and the University of Mississippi
      Medical Center, with the use of common maternal state protocols, minimum criteria
      for baseline fetal heart rate reactivity, and follow-up of abnormal test results.
      At the Medical College of Georgia, 656 patients were studied with nonstress tests
      used as the primary test, whereas at the University of Mississippi Medical
      Center, 614 patients were managed with the nipple stimulation contraction stress 
      test used as the primary test. Both populations were comparable in regard to
      pregnancy complications, gestational age, birth weight, perinatal outcomes,
      cesarean section rates, and the incidence of positive contraction stress tests.
      Specificity and positive and negative predictive values were similar for both
      tests. The extended nonstress test had higher sensitivity but also required
      significantly longer mean duration of testing. The corrected perinatal mortality 
      rate for a reactive nonstress test or negative nipple stimulation contraction
      stress test was zero within one week of the last test. We conclude that both
      tests provide excellent primary methods of fetal surveillance and that the
      decision to use one test rather than the other should be made on the basis of
      considerations of cost, convenience, time availability, and the presence of
      specific test contraindications or pregnancy complications.

PG  - 121-4
AB  - A breast stimulation technique is currently being used for stimulation of uterine
      contractions when a contraction stress test is indicated for antepartal fetal
      evaluation. The breast stimulation stress test is considered a practical
      alternative to the intravenous oxytocin stress test and may be as effective in
      producing contractions adequate for evaluation of fetal reserve as reflected in a
      fetal heart rate tracing. Along with a review of related research findings and
      the purpose of using the breast stimulation stress test indications for use and a
      step-by-step protocol are provided. In addition, the problem of hyperstimulation 
      of uterine contractions and psychological considerations for the pregnant patient
      requiring a breast stimulation stress test are included.

TI  - Comparison of uterine activity induced by nipple stimulation and oxytocin.
PG  - 74-8
AB  - Intermittent nipple stimulation has been proposed as a substitute for exogenous
      oxytocin infusion in the performance of contraction stress tests. To compare the 
      uterine activity produced by these two methods, we studied a group of 45 term
      pregnant women undergoing indicated inductions of labor. Twenty-five patients had
      nipple stimulation and 20 patients received oxytocin infusions according to a
      study protocol. The two groups were similar in all obstetric parameters. Pre- and
      posttest uterine activity was measured by internal tocodynamometry and quantified
      in Montevideo units. A significant increase in uterine activity occurred in both 
      groups (P less than .01). Regular uterine activity (three contractions in ten
      minutes) was achieved more rapidly (P less than .005), but at a lower level (P
      less than .001) in the nipple stimulation group. Pre- and posttest tonus did not 
      change significantly in either group. In the nipple stimulation group, five
      patients (20%) did not achieve adequate contraction patterns after 15
      stimulation-rest cycles (a total of 110 minutes) and three subjects (12%)
      experienced uterine hyperstimulation. These observations suggest that exogenous
      oxytocin and intermittent nipple stimulation may not have equivalent effects on
      uterine contractility. Therefore, it may not be justified to substitute one
      technique for the other or to use the same criteria for interpretation of
      contraction stress tests produced by both techniques.

AB  - Breast stimulation as a "contraction stress test" has been proposed as an
      alternative test to oxytocin to check the well being of the fetus. 162 breast
      stimulation tests were carried out in 146 patients with an indication for a
      "contraction stress test". The stress rate was 66.6%. 8% of the tests showed
      hyperstimulation without any fetal complications. There was no difference between
      the types of patients where the test was successful, failed or resulted in
      hyperstimulation. Where the tests failed, oxytocin tests were carried out. The
      time needed for these was, on the whole, double that taken for the breast
      stimulation tests. The two techniques can be comparable, both from correlation of
      the results with the indication and the outcome for the infant. The mothers
      tolerated the breast stimulation test very well indeed.

AB  - A test for uteroplacental insufficiency based on the idea that a given
      maternal-foetal unit could be tested by decreasing intervillous space blood flow,
      offers an individual test for each foetus. Clinically, the use of uterine
      activity to decrease intervillous space blood flow is the most practical.
      Following Freeman's suggestion, authors use an endogenous oxytocin test, where
      the oxytocin discharge is induced by nipple stimulation (EOS).

TI  - Prolonged electrical stimulation of the nipples evokes intermittent milk ejection
      in the anaesthetised lactating rat.
PG  - 29-34
AB  - Intermittent and continuous electrical stimulation of the nipples elicited
      milk-ejection responses in the lactating rat. The responses occurred
      intermittently, with similar amplitudes and periodicity as those seen in suckled 
      rats. The responses were always associated with synchronization of the
      electroencephalogram (EEG), but some rats with synchronized EEG activity did not 
      milk eject during stimulation. Since continuous stimulation also resulted in
      intermittent milk ejection it seems unlikely that the periodicity of the reflex
      in suckled rats depends upon changes in the intensity of sensory stimulation. The
      techniques of nipple stimulation may be a useful method with which to study
      neural pathways and other phenomena such as gating involved in oxytocin release
      and milk ejection. The success of the technique depends on a variety of factors
      such as parameters of the stimulation and state of anaesthesia.

PG  - 821-6
AB  - Samples of human milk obtained from lactating women in the early postpartum
      period were assayed for oxytocin concentrations by specific RIA, following
      extraction procedures with Florisil. Mean oxytocin concentrations in human milk
      at postpartum day 1 to 5 were 4.5 +/- 1.1, 4.7 +/- 1.1, 4.0 +/- 1.3, 3.2 +/- 0.4,
      3.3 +/- 0.6 microunits/ml (+/- SE), respectively. Oxytocin levels in milk were
      significantly increased by nursing (3.1 +/- 0.6, 5.3 +/- 1.0 microunits/ml,
      respectively). 3H-oxytocin in human milk was stable even after incubation at 37
      degrees C for 2 hours. The dilution curve for milk was parallel to the curve for 
      the standard oxytocin. The chromatographic fraction of immunoreactive oxytocin
      was identical to that of 3H-oxytocin. 3H-oxytocin was administered to lactating
      rats. Radioactivity in the neonatal gastric contents and plasma were 12.8% and
      4.4% of the counts in the maternal plasma. It was made clear that oxytocin is
      stable in milk and that oxytocin in maternal blood can be transferred to mik and 
      then to neonates.

TI  - The nipple stimulation contraction stress test.
PG  - 459-62
AB  - The nipple stimulation contraction stress test is finding increasing favor as an 
      alternative or adjunct to the nonstress test as an assessment of fetal
      well-being. The nipple stimulation contraction stress test has been found to be
      an effective, convenient alternative to the costly, time-consuming oxytocin
      challenge test. Current literature and protocols are reviewed to compare
      effectiveness, predictive value for perinatal outcomes, and current
      recommendations concerning the safe and effective use of the nipple stimulation
      contraction stress test for antepartum testing. A protocol provides clear
      guidelines for antepartum testing with the nipple stimulation contraction stress 
      test.

TI  - Contraction stress test by nipple stimulation: efficacy and safety.
PG  - 1102-5
AB  - During a one-year period, 838 nonstress tests, 425 nipple stimulation contraction
      stress tests (NS-CSTs), and 115 spontaneous CSTs were done. Results were compared
      to those of NSTs and CSTs done by classic methods during a previous one-year
      period. The results revealed no hyperstimulation from contraction stress testing 
      with nipple stimulation, and a significant reduction in the time to perform both 
      tests conducted simultaneously when compared to the nonstress test plus classic
      oxytocin challenge test. The time to perform the combined tests compared to the
      routine nonstress test was not significantly different. Moreover, a cost-saving
      was also demonstrated. The combination of the NST and nipple stimulation CST
      appeared to be safe, efficacious, and cost-effective.

TI  - Breast stimulation in cycling women, pregnant women and a woman with induced
      lactation: pattern of release of oxytocin, prolactin and luteinizing hormone.
PG  - 97-106
AB  - Levels of oxytocin (OT) and PRL were measured in plasma drawn before and during
      intermittent mechanical pump and tactile stimulation of the breast in five normal
      cycling women and 19 women in the third trimester of pregnancy. OT was
      significantly increased above baseline in response to breast stimulation in two
      of five cycling women and PRL increased in one of the two OT responders. In
      pregnant women, mean OT post nipple stimulation was significantly higher than pre
      nipple stimulation whereas PRL did not increase significantly. The response of OT
      to nipple stimulation occurred in 18 of 19 pregnant women compared to only two of
      five normal cycling women but the magnitude of the OT response in pregnant women 
      was less than in cycling women or post-partum lactating women previously studied 
      in this laboratory. In one non post-partum woman who induced lactation for the
      purpose of breast-feeding an adopted infant, OT and PRL were measured before and 
      during mechanical pump and tactile stimulation before initiation of
      breast-feeding. OT increased during mechanical pump and tactile stimulation of
      the breast, as well as suckling, whereas PRL increased only in response to
      suckling. Levels of LH were measured in plasma every 20 min for 160 min at the
      following times: before initiation of breast-feeding, during induced lactation
      while breast-feeding, and 30 d after discontinuation of breast-feeding. Despite
      the development of oligomenorrhoea during the period of breast-feeding, levels of
      progesterone were not suppressed and LH was released in a normal pulsatile
      fashion.

TI  - A prospective longitudinal study of the release of oxytocin and prolactin in
      response to infant suckling in long term lactation.
PG  - 653-7
AB  - We studied prospectively eight healthy postpartum breast-feeding women for 6
      months during early, middle, and late lactation. Blood for measurement of
      oxytocin (OT), PRL, and arginine vasopressin was drawn before and every 3 min
      from each women during 15 min of infant suckling for two consecutive feedings
      during each stage of lactation. Basal plasma OT was not different in
      breast-feeding [0.7 +/- 0.1 (+/- SEM) microU/ml] and nonbreast-feeding women (0.8
      +/- 0.2 microU/ml). OT increased significantly in response to infant suckling (P 
      less than 0.00001) to 5.9 +/- 0.5 microU/ml and remained elevated throughout a
      feeding. OT was released during infant suckling in an episodic pattern in some,
      but not all, women; peak OT varied among women (5.0-23.3 microU/ml). There was no
      significant difference in the mean stimulated OT or the pattern of release
      comparing the first and second feedings of the same day. The mean OT (n = 8)
      released during 15 min of infant suckling was not significantly different in
      early (3.9 +/- 0.3 microU/ml), middle (4.5 +/- 0.3 microU/ml), and late (5.8 +/- 
      0.4 microU/ml) lactation. In the four women who breast fed exclusively, the mean 
      stimulated OT was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) during late lactation
      (8.6 +/- 0.4 microU/ml) vs. early (4.6 +/- 0.4 microU/ml) or middle (6.1 +/- 0.4 
      microU/ml) lactation. In the other four women who provided formula supplements,
      OT did not change. Plasma arginine vasopressin did not increase in response to
      infant suckling. Plasma PRL increased in response to infant suckling, reaching a 
      peak at 15 min. Mean basal PRL decreased progressively from weeks 1-24
      postpartum. Mean peak PRL decreased significantly from early (162 +/- 29) to
      middle (130 +/- 15) to late (77 +/- 10) ng/ml lactation (P less than 0.05). OT
      release in response to infant suckling continues throughout the first 6 months
      postpartum in breast-feeding women, and the pattern is reproducible. The maximum 
      release of OT is dependent upon continuous regular nipple stimulation. In
      contrast to basal and suckling-induced levels of PRL, which decreased with time
      postpartum, basal and suckling-induced OT release did not decrease from early to 
      late lactation.

TI  - Breast stimulation contraction stress test: uterine contractions in the absence
      of oxytocin release.
PG  - 35-7
AB  - The contraction stress test has been widely used to manage high-risk pregnancies.
      Breast-stimulated uterine contractions have been assumed to be mediated through
      oxytocin release. We studied 20 women undergoing a breast-stimulated contraction 
      stress test. There was no significant increase in plasma oxytocin levels during
      this study in either test responders or nonresponders. These results suggest that
      the presence of a breast stimulation-uterine contraction reflex is not mediated
      by oxytocin.

PG  - 355-9
AB  - The authors have evaluated the effect of stimulation of the breast on uterine
      tone in a series of 25 patients at term where induction of labour was indicated
      for obstetric reasons. In 64% of cases breast stimulation carried out for 30
      minutes was followed by uterine contractions. In 20% of these cases the authors
      found that the uterus contracted strongly and in two patients so strongly as to
      cause fetal heart slowing. Breast stimulation matures the cervix slightly but
      this is not statistically significant for Bishop's score. In 16% of case breast
      stimulation provoked labour. Analysing these results and studying the literature 
      shows that the effect is linked to the degree of cervical maturity at the onset
      and the effect of stimulation depends also on the length of time the stimulation 
      was carried out. In practice the use of breast stimulation is limited because of 
      the risks of hypertonic contractions and this is turn requires careful fetal
      heart monitoring.

TI  - Blood velocities to the female breast during lactation and following oxytocin
      injections.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - A heterodyne pulsed doppler velocitymeter was used to measure blood velocities in
      the mammary branch of the lateral thoracic artery during breast-feeding and after
      oxytocin injections. A few heart beats before the mother felt the milk-ejection
      reflex, blood velocities fell rapidly by 40-50%, and then increased during the
      next 1-2 min. Synthetic oxytocin was given intravenously to lactating women, both
      in doses believed to be physiological in milk-ejection and larger, and the same
      velocity changes occurred. Synthetic oxytocin was also given to non-lactating
      women who had never been pregnant or who had breast-fed previously and to one
      man. In these a rapid increase in velocity was observed after about a half a
      minute, lasting for 1-2 min. In addition to the short-term effects of
      breast-feeding, blood velocity increased rapidly towards the end of nursing or a 
      few minutes afterwards, with a maximal increase of 25-50%. It then slowly
      returned to pre-nursing values during the following 30-60 min. This pattern was
      seen in both breasts, independent of which breast the infant had been sucking.

TI  - Breast massage to obtain contraction stress test.
PG  - 338-41
AB  - A standard contraction stress test (CST) is usually obtained by the intravenous
      infusion of exogenous oxytocin for 1 to 3 hours. To assess whether breast massage
      could elicit a CST, 30 high-risk pregnant women between 37 and 44 weeks gestation
      massaged their breasts with mineral oil for a maximum of 40 to 60 minutes. Of the
      21 patients (70%) who met the CST criterion, 15 had at least one spontaneous
      uterine contraction in the 20 minutes preceding breast massage, p = .05.
      Thirty-three percent of those who met the CST criterion did so within 10 minutes 
      of the start of breast massage, and 95% met the criterion within 40 minutes.
      Other factors, including weeks gestation, parity, overstimulation, and fetal
      heart rate deceleration that could reasonably influence the effectiveness of the 
      procedure are discussed. Breast massage appears to be an effective method for
      meeting the CST criterion.

OAB - Studies of the few remaining hunter-gatherer societies reveal that a birth
      spacing interval of up to 4 years can be realized without benefit of any modern
      contraceptives. The main explanation for this phenomenon is that breastfeeding is
      practiced in primitive societies for long durations and the infant suckles on
      demand (i.e., throughout the day and night) rather than on a schedule. Such a
      feeding pattern, coupled with an atmosphere that encourages breastfeeding, can
      postpone ovulation for 1-2 years, or possibly even longer. Suckling -- crucial to
      understanding how breastfeeding postpones ovluation -- induces the release of 2
      hormones, namely, prolactin and oxytocin. Prolactin is involved in the production
      of milk and oxytocin works to eject the milk. 2 crucial factors involved in
      breastfeeding's contraceptive effect appear to be, in order of importance, the
      frequency of feeding episodes and the duration of its practice. More frequent
      suckling episodes produce more prolactin than do fewer episodes, and longer
      feedings produce more milk for future feedings. It is doubtful that prolactin
      directly inhibits ovulation; rather, its level may be an accurate index for some 
      other factor that inhibits ovulation. Researchers do agree that the frequency
      and, to a lesser extent, the duration of suckling episodes, as well as the
      absence of supplemental feeding, are good predictors of how long ovulation will
      be postponed. If breastfeeding were totally instinctive to humans, perhaps its
      contraceptive effectiveness would only be dependent on physiological
      characteristics. Yet, even if a mother is willing to practice unrestricted
      breastfeeding, the physiological functions also are influenced by psychological
      factors. Breastfeeding is learned. Attitudes of hospital staff, relatives,
      friends, and the community towards breastfeeding can affect breastfeeding
      patterns and hence its contraceptive effectiveness. The "let-down reflex" is the 
      Pavlovian response to suckling that sets milk production and ejection into
      motion. In some instances, the infant's cry for food can induce the reflex,
      pointing to the powerful interplay between emotions of the mother and her
      physical response. In developing countries, the main reason mothers give for
      ceasing to breastfeed is a lack of milk. The tragedy is that in most cases, the
      woman who believes that she has too little milk actually has too much.
      Environments that make breastfeeding appear backward, embarrassing, or
      inconvenient, however, can inhibit the let-down reflex and thus decrease the
      frequency and duration of suckling.

TI  - Smoking and reproductive health.
PG  - 175-86
AB  - Numerous studies have identified specific areas in which the effects of maternal 
      smoking during pregnancy may occur including fetal growth retardation, neonatal
      deaths, pregnancy complications leading to premature delivery and possible
      effects on lactation and long-term effects on surviving children. Despite the
      number of papers which have been published on this subject there is still no
      clear understanding of the extent to which smoking in general, and various
      components of cigarette smoke in particular, exert a detrimental effect on the
      human reproductive potential. Although epidemiological evidence is scanty there
      are indications that cigarette smoking decreases fertility in women, increases
      the frequency of menstrual abnormalities and decreases the age of spontaneous
      menopause. Cigarette smoking in males has also been implicated as a cause of
      decreased sperm numbers and an increased frequency of abnormal sperm morphology
      as well as a decrease in sexual performance. Experimental evidence from humans
      and rodents suggests that nicotine can alter the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
      through its stimulation of growth hormone, cortisol, vasopressin and oxytocin
      release which in turn inhibit luteinizing hormone and prolactin release.

PG  - 465-71
AB  - The contraction stress test (CST) is used widely as a measure of fetoplacental
      respiratory reserve. With contractions traditionally induced by intravenous
      oxytocin, the test has been limited in its use by time, expense and patient
      discomfort. In a prospective evaluation of the effectiveness of nipple
      stimulation for the production of uterine contractions, a successful CST was
      obtained in 94% of the attempts, with a mean total test time of 12 minutes.

PG  - 770-4
AB  - Interview and record review data from 12,023 singleton deliveries were analyzed
      to determine the relationships between neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (10 mg/dL or
      greater) and maternal characteristics. Confounding variables were controlled by
      multiple logistic regression analysis. There was a statistically significant
      positive relationship between hyperbilirubinemia and low birth weight, Oriental
      race, premature rupture of membranes, breast-feeding, neonatal infection, use of 
      the "pill" at time of conception, instrumental delivery, and history of first
      trimester bleeding. Maternal smoking and black race were negatively related to
      hyperbilirubinemia and statistically significant. In this study, other previously
      suspected etiologic factors such as epidural anesthesia, parity, use of oxytocin 
      in labor, and white race were not associated with hyperbilirubinemia.

TI  - Water intoxication and hyponatremic encephalopathy from the use of an oxytocin
      nasal spray. A case report.
PG  - 225-8
AB  - Many nursing women returning to a full-time job and desiring to continue to
      breast feed are using oxytocin nasal sprays to facilitate breast emptying during 
      the work day. Very few complications have been reported from its use, and the
      preparation has been assumed to be innocuous. However, we encountered a nursing
      mother whose life appears to have been jeopardized by the excessive and
      unmonitored application of such a spray. The patient was hospitalized for a viral
      illness and given a large quantity of intravenous fluid. In association with
      excessive self-administration of an oxytocin nasal spray, she developed severe
      water intoxication, with hyponatremic encephalopathy and convulsions. During the 
      same hospitalization the patient subsequently developed a Guillain-Barre type of 
      peripheral polyneuritis. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic 
      hormone has been reported to accompany the neurologic manifestations of the
      Guillain-Barre syndrome and may have been the cause of the convulsions. However, 
      the temporal associations in this case strongly favor the unmonitored use of the 
      oxytocin nasal spray as etiologic.

PG  - 670-9
AB  - Self-stimulations of nipples were performed in 155 late pregnant women in
      connection with antenatal cardiotocography (nonstress test). Cardiotocographs
      were interpreted using an own score. Uterine contractions could be produced by
      nipple stimulation in 111 women (71.6 per cent). In 13 cases with score 6 to 8
      these contraction contributed to explantation of fetal condition. In additional
      11 cases with score 9 to 10 the attention was focussed to the reduced fetal or
      placental capacity by the suspect cardiotocogram. In this group frequency of
      caesarean section was increased significantly. In cases with successful nipple
      stimulation the rate of labour induction with effect was higher. Oxytocin
      liberation by nipple stimulation may be regarded as endogenous oxytocin stress
      test. This simple procedure which can be done quickly and without danger is
      supposed to be a good supplement to nonstress test. Its reliability can be
      improved and the success of induction of labour estimated.

PG  - 3-6
AB  - Non-stress tests (NSTs) and oxytocin challenge tests (OCTs) are widely used in
      most prenatal units for the assessment and monitoring of patients with high risk 
      pregnancies. The contraction stress test is considered to be one of the best
      tests for evaluating fetal wellbeing in indicated cases. For this purpose, the
      OCT is usually used. It is a time-consuming test. An intravenous i.v. and
      oxytocin are both required, and it is therefore relatively costly. In this study,
      a non-invasive technique--breast stimulation--was used to induce uterine
      contractions for the purpose of contraction stress testing. Sixty-six patients
      were studied, and a total of 95 breast stimulation tests (BSTs) were done. 91
      tests were successful contraction stress tests (95.78%). The high success rate,
      the fact that this is a non-invasive method, its easy application and the fact
      that this test is less expensive and much less time consuming make it a good test
      for the assessment of fetuses at risk.

TI  - A novel oxytocin-like and vasotocin-like peptide in human plasma after
      administration of estrogen.
PG  - 5-12
AB  - Using three antisera to oxytocin (OT Pitt Ab-1, OT Pitt Ab-2, and TOR OT Ab), we 
      found comparable levels of OT in response to infant suckling and during infusion 
      of synthetic OT, and identical standard curves with biological and synthetic
      standards of OT. Pitt Ab-1, but not Pitt Ab-2 or TOR OT Ab, measured increased OT
      in response to estrogen. Using an arginine vasotocin RIA (TOR AVT Ab), we found
      an increase in AVT immunoreactivity after estrogen treatment. Mean basal OT
      levels measured with OT Pitt Ab-2 in plasma of men [0.75 +/- 0.06 (+/- SEM)
      microU/ml] and women (0.8 +/- 0.09 microU/ml) were lower than OT measured with
      Pitt Ab-1 (1.7 +/- 0.09 microU/ml in men and 1.7 +/- 0.07 microU/al in women; P
      less than 0.001). Mean OT measured with Pitt Ab-2 in the plasma of women given
      estrogen chronically (0.8 +/- 0.04 microU/ml) and acutely (0.6 +/- 0.15
      microU/ml) were not significantly different from basal levels. OT levels measured
      with Pitt Ab-1 in the same samples were 4.6 +/- 0.5 and 4.3 +/- 0.5 microU/ml,
      respectively, both significantly increased from basal levels (P less than 0.001) 
      and significantly higher than OT measured with Pitt Ab-2 (P less than 0.001).
      Mean OT measured with Pitt Ab-1 in the plasma of pregnant women was 8.6 +/- 1.02 
      microU/ml, significantly higher than OT measured with Pitt Ab-2 (1.0 +/- 0.3
      microU/ml; P less than 0.001). Men given 25 mg diethylstilbestrol had significant
      increases in OT measured with Pitt Ab-1 and in AVT measured with TOR AVT (P less 
      than 0.01), but not in OT measured with Pitt Ab-2. Plasma from a man given
      diethylstilbestrol was prepared for high performance liquid chromatography and
      applied to a C18 muBondapak reverse phase column. The plasma contained two peaks 
      of immunoreactivity detected as OT with Pitt Ab-1 and as AVT using TOR AVT Ab.
      The material was not detected by Pitt Ab-2 or TOR OT Ab and did not coelute with 
      standards of OT, AVT, or AVP. Pregnancy plasma, thioglycolic acid, chymotrypsin, 
      and trypsin reduced Pitt Ab-1, Pitt Ab-2, and TOR OT immunoreactivity of
      synthetic OT. The percent recovery of OT immunoreactivity was not significantly
      different with Pitt Ab-1 vs. Pitt Ab-2. A novel peptide, which is increased in
      response to administered estrogen, is present in human plasma and is detected by 
      some antisera to OT and AVT. The observation explains the wide variability in OT 
      levels in the estrogen-primed state and provides a new mechanism to study
      estrogen-related physiology and pathophysiology.

AB  - Synthetic oxytocin (OT) conjugated to bovine thyroglobulin by the carbodiimide
      reaction was injected into rabbits to raise a high titre, specific OT antiserum
      which was then coupled to microcrystalline cellulose activated by cyanogen
      bromide. High affinity of the coupled antiserum was defined by Scatchard
      analysis, Keq = 7.1 X 10(11)1/mol. Cross-reactivity studies revealed little
      binding of antiserum to analogues of OT. Iodination was performed by the
      Chloramine T method, giving specific activity of 125I-OT, range 1.1 - 1.7 X 10(3)
      Ci/mmol. After incubation for 40 hours under disequilibrium conditions, specific 
      and non-specific bindings were 10.6 +/- 2.7% and 0.2 +/- 0.1% (n=15),
      respectively. Displacement of 50% 125I-OT occurred with 2.9 pg OT/tube.
      Coefficients of variation of standard OT concentrations (0.03 - 16 pg/tube) were 
      less than 5%. Limit of detection was 2 pg OT/ml plasma. Recovery of synthetic OT 
      added to non-pregnant plasma was 81.8% (n=34) at 20 pg/ml and 97.4% (n=32) at 100
      pg/ml. Two patients, 17 and 18 weeks post-partum, had increases in plasma OT from
      less than 2 pg/ml to 18.3 and 16.0 pg/ml after 6 and 4 minutes breast feeding
      infants, respectively. We conclude that this solid phase OT radioimmunoassay is
      quick, relatively sensitive and reliable, and does not require prior extraction
      of plasma samples.

TI  - Acute inhibition of rat myometrial responses to oxytocin by tamoxifen
      stereoisomers and oestradiol.
PG  - 383-8
AB  - The non-steroidal antioestrogen tamoxifen
      (trans-1-(4-beta-dimethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1,2-diphenylbut- 1-ene), widely used 
      in the treatment of breast cancer, and its oestrogenic cis-isomer rapidly
      inhibited contractile responses of isolated rat myometrium to supramaximal
      concentrations of oxytocin (1.28 X 10(-6) mol/l). Both compounds were effective
      at concentrations comparable with the plasma concentrations of tamoxifen reached 
      in therapy (i.e. 5 X 10(-7) to 5 X 10(-6) mol/l). Inhibition was too rapid in
      onset (less than 3 min) to involve changes in RNA transcription and protein
      synthesis, and was not prevented or reversed by the addition of oestradiol to the
      bath. We conclude that the inhibition did not involve the classical oestrogen
      receptor pathway. Oestradiol-17 beta at concentrations above 10(-6) mol/l also
      inhibited the myometrium and potentiated the effects of the anti-oestrogens. Our 
      experiments suggest that the anti-oestrogens and oestradiol act via a similar
      route with tamoxifen having an equilibrium affinity approximately tenfold greater
      than that of oestradiol.

TI  - Use of breast stimulation for antepartum stress testing.
PG  - 641-5
AB  - Bilateral breast stimulation was used to evoke a spontaneous contraction stress
      test. The success rate and incidence of abnormal uterine activity using the
      stimulus was compared with patients tested by the authors' standard oxytocin
      stress test protocol. Bilateral breast stimulation was initially used for 346
      tests between 32 and 43 weeks of gestational age. A satisfactory test, or three
      contractions within ten minutes, was obtained in 239 (69%) patients. The testing 
      time was reduced with successful breast stimulation. The incidence of abnormal
      uterine activity after breast stimulation was not statistically different from
      that observed with oxytocin administration alone. However, when oxytocin was
      administered after breast stimulation, there was a significant increase in the
      incidence of prolonged contractions.

TI  - Contraction stress test by intermittent nipple stimulation.
PG  - 669-73
AB  - Although the nonstress test has generally supplanted the contraction stress test 
      as the primary test for assessment of fetal well-being, the contraction stress
      test continues to be useful. Objectionable factors of the contraction stress test
      have included the time required to complete the test and the frequent necessity
      for intravenous oxytocin. The authors developed a contraction stress test
      protocol using contractions produced by intermittent nipple stimulation and used 
      the method for 345 tests on 193 high-risk pregnancies during a 15-month period.
      The women were instructed to stimulate one breast, through their clothes, for two
      minutes and then to rest for five minutes. This cycle was repeated as necessary, 
      but was interrupted whenever contractions began. Using this protocol, the authors
      were successful in achieving an adequate contraction frequency with every
      attempt, and hyperstimulation was not more frequent than previously reported with
      the standard contraction stress test. The average time requirement was 45
      minutes. No unexplained stillbirths occurred after a negative test.

TI  - [Assistance procedures in the perinatal period that condition breast feeding at
      the time of discharge from the hospital].
PG  - 367-72
AB  - The authors have evaluated the influence of some obstetric events (type and
      duration of labour and method of delivery) and some pharmacological factors
      (oxytocic drugs during labour, local infiltration, duration of general
      anaesthesia, oxytocic drugs and/or ergot derivatives during puerperium) on
      frequency of breast-feeding at the time of discharge from hospital. About 57% of 
      356 newborns were breast-fed (wholly or prevalently) at discharge from the "A.
      Gemelli" University Hospital in Rome, during two months period (march-april
      1981). The results showed that all those conditions requiring medical and
      paramedical action, either instrumental or pharmacological (such as: induced
      labour, prolonged labour, operative delivery either vaginal or abdominal,
      particularly in emergency; use of local infiltration; use of oxytocic drugs
      during labour, particularly for induction; prolonged general anaesthesia in
      caesarean section) may have an unfavorable effect, nearly always significant, on 
      breast-feeding. According with these results, the Authors suggest the following
      measures for breast-feeding promotional programme: modification of neonatal
      routine care to promote an earlier mother-infant interaction during lying-in;
      limitation of avoidable obstetric procedures and of drugs giving to mothers; a
      better understanding of pharmacokinetics, both in mothers (placentar passage of
      drugs and through milk) and in newborns during labour, delivery and puerperium.

TI  - Contraction stress testing with mammary self-stimulation.
PG  - 219-21
AB  - One hundred fifty-six women with high-risk pregnancies performed mammary
      self-stimulation 256 times in an attempt to induce uterine contractions that
      would meet contraction-stress-test criteria. One hundred forty-nine, or 57%, of
      the attempts resulted in contractions of adequate duration and frequency to
      satisfy those criteria. Patient acceptance of the procedure was very high; only
      one patient refused to participate. Performing a contraction stress test through 
      mammary self-stimulation was found to shorten the time that successful patients
      stayed in the testing area and eliminated the need for an intravenous oxytocin
      challenge test.

      menstrual cycle.
PG  - 457-60
AB  - Plasma oxytocin concentrations were measured during 12 minutes of mechanical pump
      stimulation in nine healthy women during the follicular and luteal phases of the 
      menstrual cycle. In the follicular phase (and in five healthy male subjects),
      plasma oxytocin values did not increase above baseline levels with breast pump
      stimulation. In contrast, pump stimulation evoked a significant increase in
      plasma oxytocin levels during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. These
      observations suggest that oxytocin secretion is modulated by hormones involved in
      the menstrual cycle in women.

AB  - The usefulness of breast stimulation to elicit uterine contractions as a
      contraction stress test in fetal surveillance in high-risk pregnancies was
      investigated. The test was successful in fulfilling the criteria of contraction
      stress testing in 48 out of 76 mothers (62%). Success rates were not affected by 
      the duration of pregnancy after 36 weeks. Nor did parity have any significant
      effect. The results of the breast stimulation test (BST) correlated well with the
      preceding non-stress test. Only one positive BST was detected in this population.
      In this case the late decelerations were present even during labor the next day. 
      BST seems to be a practicable tool, in preference to the oxytocin challenge test,
      for fetal surveillance.

TI  - Treatment of inadequate lactation with oral sulpiride and buccal oxytocin.
PG  - 57-60
AB  - Thirty-six puerperal women with inadequate lactation were treated with 50 mg
      sulpiride (N = 24) or placebo (N = 12) three times a day for two weeks. These
      treatments were supplemented with buccal oxytocin (100 IU, 300 IU, or 400 IU) or 
      placebo preceding each breast-feeding on the sixth and 14th and on the seventh
      and 13th days of oral treatment, respectively. One woman treated with sulpiride
      and three women treated with placebo discontinued the trial because of the lack
      of the effect of treatment. The concentration of prolactin in maternal serum was 
      higher (P less than .001) during sulpiride than placebo treatment at one week
      (380 +/- 43 ng/ml vs 23 +/- 7 ng/ml, mean +/- SE) and two weeks of treatment (381
      +/- 38 ng/ml vs 34 +/- 10 ng/ml). Also, the daily breast milk yield, as measured 
      objectively, was greater (P less than .05) during sulpiride than placebo
      treatment both at one week (628 +/- 51 ml vs 440 +/- 68 ml) and two weeks of
      treatment (684 +/- 67 ml vs 423 +/- 60 ml). Various doses of oxytocin failed to
      stimulate the milk secretion in the presence or absence of sulpiride-induced
      hyperprolactinemia. Thus, sulpiride improved inadequate lactation, whereas
      exogenous oxytocin alone or together with sulpiride had no effect on lactation in
      these mothers whose infants were able to suckle normally.

TI  - Neonatal bilirubin levels and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency in
      preterm and low-birth-weight infants in Israel.
PG  - 1056-8
AB  - Eight hundred preterm (PT) and low-birth-weight (LBW) infants, born during a
      period of 33 months, were examined for erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity. Each of 17 infants with G6PD deficiency was
      compared with the next PT or LBW infant born with normal enzyme activity. The
      groups were similar with respect to gestational age, birth weight, maximal weight
      loss, breast or formula feeding and the use of oxytocin during labor. Peak
      bilirubin levels were significantly higher in G6PD-deficient PT and LBW infants
      (11.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 9.5 +/- 2.1 mg/dl, P less than 0.001). There were no signs of
      frank hemolysis, and none of the patients underwent exchange transfusion. Early
      jaundice and the use of phototherapy were somewhat more frequent among the
      G6PD-deficient group, but not significantly so. It is suggested that PT and LBW
      infants born to parents of Asian or North African origin be routinely screened
      for erythrocyte G6PD activity and monitored for possible jaundice.

TI  - Oxytocin and prolactin responses in long-term breast-feeding.
PG  - 565-8
AB  - Plasma levels of oxytocin and prolactin were measured before and during 12
      minutes of breast pump stimulation in five healthy, lactating, amenorrheic women 
      on three occasions: ten to 90 days post partum, 90 to 180 days post partum, and
      180 days to one year post partum. Baseline mean (+/- SEM) plasma oxytocin levels 
      were similar in the three study periods. Mean stimulated plasma oxytocin levels
      increased in the three study periods (each P less than .001; mean baseline versus
      stimulated). Stimulated plasma oxytocin values were significantly greater at ten 
      to 90 than at 90 to 180 days (P less than .05; analysis of variance). Baseline
      serum prolactin levels were 61 +/- 9.5, 36 +/- 8.6, and 33 +/- 10.8 ng/ml,
      respectively (not significant; one-way analysis of variance). Mean stimulated
      prolactin levels were 71 +/- 8.1, 43 +/- 4.5, and 43 +/- 2.8 ng/ml, respectively 
      (not significant). Thus, the oxytocin secretory reflex continues in long-term
      lactation for the first year post partum. In addition, breast stimulation in
      long-term lactating women continues to produce a slight increase in serum
      prolactin levels.

TI  - Mechanisms of control of milk intake in suckling rats.
PG  - R154-9
AB  - To reconcile reported differences in the development of internal controls over
      milk intake via suckling, infant rats 5-20 days of age were allowed to withdraw
      milk from anesthetized dams periodically induced to let down milk by intravenous 
      infusion of oxytocin. In experiment 1, milk supply was made unlimited by
      providing pups with a series of milk-replete dams. Five- and ten-day-old pups
      withdrew inappropriately large volumes of milk, whereas 15- and 20-day-old pups
      limited intake to moderate volumes. In experiment 2, intake of deprived and
      nondeprived pups was measured after only 10 oxytocin-induced milk letdowns,
      comparable to the normal nursing bout. When milk availability was thus limited,
      pups of all ages consumed volumes of milk dependent on their level of
      deprivation. Moreover intake of pups 10-20 days of age was highly correlated with
      incidence of nipple shifting. Thus rats as young as 5 days of age can vary the
      rate at which milk is taken from a limited source; however, not until 15 days are
      they able to control the volume withdrawn from an unlimited source.

TI  - Release of oxytocin and prolactin in response to suckling.
PG  - 257-9
AB  - The oxytocin and prolactin responses to suckling were measured in 10 women in
      early (n = 5) and established lactation (n = 5). Oxytocin was released in a
      pulsatile manner during suckling in all women, but the response was not related
      to milk volume, prolactin response, or parity of the mother. In all 10 women
      plasma oxytocin concentrations increased three to 10 minutes before suckling
      began. In five women this occurred in response to the baby crying, in three it
      coincided with the baby becoming restless in expectation of the feed, while in
      two it corresponded with the mother preparing for the feed. There was no
      prolactin response to stimuli other than stimulation of the nipple associated
      with suckling. These results clearly indicate that the milk ejection reflex, with
      release of oxytocin, occurs in most women before the tactile stimulus of
      suckling. A second release of oxytocin follows in response to the suckling
      stimulus itself. Thus it is important that care is taken to protect breast
      feeding mothers from stress not only during suckling but also immediately before 
      nursing, when conditioned releases of oxytocin will occur.

AB  - A prospective study was conducted in a level II maternity unit to investigate the
      incidence of hyperbilirubinemia in healthy, term, breast-fed and formula-fed
      infants. Serum bilirubin levels were determined for 176 breast-red and 164
      formula-fed infants in cord blood and on days 1, 2, 3 and 5 after birth. The mean
      total bilirubin levels were significantly higher on each postnatal day in the
      breast-fed infants, as was the proportion of infants with peak levels above 12
      mg/dl (205 mumol/l; 28% v. 6%). The breast-fed infants also had significantly
      higher proportional weight losses on each postnatal day than the formula-fed
      infants. However, there was no correlation between the cumulative weight loss on 
      day 3 and bilirubin levels on the same day with either feeding regimen. None of
      the infants required an exchange transfusion or prolonged care in hospital for
      hyperbilirubinemia.

AB  - The hormonal responses to breast-feeding were studied during the first 3
      post-partum weeks in ten women smoking more than fifteen cigarettes/day and in a 
      control group. Basal PRL levels were significantly lower in smokers compared with
      non-smokers, but suckling induced acute increments in serum PRL and
      oxytocin-linked neurophysin, which were not influenced by smoking. The
      lactational pattern was normal, but smokers weaned their babies significantly
      earlier compared with non-smokers. Heavy cigarette smoking women have lower basal
      PRL levels and this may shorten the period of lactation.

OAB - Hormonal responses to breastfeeding were studied during the 1st 3 postpartum
      weeks in 10 women smoking more than 15 cigarettes/day and in 10 nonsmoking
      controls. All had had uncomplicated pregnancies resulting in term deliveries of
      infants weighing above 2800 gm. Mean age, parity, and infant birthweights were
      26.5 years, 2, and 3390 gm in smokers and 28 years, 2, and 3615 gm in nonsmokers.
      The only significant clinical difference was earlier weaning in smokers. Mean
      serum prolactin (PRL) was consistently lower in smokers. Basal levels differed
      significantly on the 1st day and in repetitive samples on the 21st postpartum
      days, when the difference was significant prior to and 120 minutes after
      breastfeeding. The difference after 12 hours of abstinence from smoking was also 
      significant. Increments in serum PRL during breastfeeding were not significantly 
      different between smokers and nonsmokers, and not influenced by abstinence from
      smoking. Basal levels and sucking-induced increments of oxytocin-linked
      neurophysin (hNp2) were similar in smokers and nonsmokers and were not influenced
      by abstinence from smoking. At the 3rd week, mean basal vasopressin-linked
      neurophysin (hNpl) was .31 ng/ml in nonsmokers and .40 ng/ml and .37 ng/ml
      respectively in smokers abstaining and not abstaining. Neither smoking nor
      breastfeeding induced any significant alteration in serum hNpl. Serum nicotine
      and plasma adrenaline but not dopamine or noradrenaline increased significantly
      during smoking. Basal levels of catecolamines were not significantly altered
      after abstinence from smoking. The lower basal PRL levels of heavy smokers may
      shorten the period of lactation.

TI  - Oxytocin enhances onset of lactation among mothers delivering prematurely.
PG  - 340-2
AB  - In a double-blind group sequential trial the efficiency of an oxytocin nasal
      spray in enhancing lactation was studied during the first five days after
      delivery in women who had given birth prematurely. The cumulative volume of
      breast milk obtained between the second and fifth days after delivery was 3.5
      times greater in primiparas given oxytocin than in primiparas given placebo.
      There was no significant difference in the composition of the milk between the
      untreated women and those given oxytocin. The results of this study show that
      oxytocin nasal spray is an effective and safe means of enhancing lactation in
      women using a breast pump.

TI  - Oxytocin release and plasma anterior pituitary and gonadal hormones in women
      during lactation.
PG  - 678-83
AB  - Serial plasma oxytocin (OT), PRL, TSH, FSH, LH, estrone, estradiol, and
      progesterone were measured by RIA in 12 women before and during a 30-min
      breast-feeding period on the third or fifth postpartum day. Plasma OT increased
      significantly from 10.8 +/- 3.4 to 22.4 +/- 3.5 pg/ml (mean +/- SE) within 2 min 
      of suckling (P = less than 0.05) to reach the mean peak level of 53.2 pg/ml at 10
      min. The increase in plasma OT was bimodal. Plasma PRL and TSH also increased
      significantly from baseline levels of 192 +/- 39 ng/ml and 16.9 +/- 5.6
      microU/ml, respectively, to reach maximum levels of 427 +/- 91 ng PRL/ml at 10
      min (P = less than 0.025) and 281.5 +/- 56.6 microU TSH/ml at 25 min (P = less
      than 0.005). Plasma FSH-beta (range of means, 3.5-4.6 ng/ml), LH (range of means,
      1.7-2.6 mIU/ml), and estradiol (range of means, 29.8-38.2 pg/ml) were low and
      remained unchanged throughout breast feeding. Plasma progesterone was 6.0 +/- 0.4
      ng/ml before breast feeding and did not alter significantly during breast
      feeding. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the milk 
      let-down reflex and the relationship of TSH to PRL.

OAB - Both the fertility inhibiting effects of breastfeeding and the lactation
      inhibiting effects of hormonal contraceptives should be considered in developing 
      postpartum family planning programs for lactating women. Because a high
      percentage of female contraceptive acceptors discontinue use within a year, the
      largest birth intervals may be achieved by delaying the initiation of
      contraception to take advantage of lactational infertility in the first
      postpartum months. Although evaluation of existing data on the effects of oral
      contraceptives on lactation is difficult, findings suggest that low-dose
      progestins may have a less detrimental effect on lactation than combined oral
      contraceptives. Depo-provera appears to enhance milk volume and duration of
      lactation, but the unknown side effects of transmission of steroids to the infant
      and changes in milk composition suggest caution in recommending it for nursing
      mothers. Results of research on possible effects of IUDs on lactation are
      conflicting and difficult to interpret, but possible mechanisms through prolactin
      secretion or oxytocin have been suggested for such an effect. Numerous
      methodological problems hamper efforts to evaluate evidence of the relationship
      of contraception to lactation to provide recommendations for family planning
      programs. The most prudent course where possible is to avoid giving hormonal
      contraceptives to the lactating woman. Where only hormonal contraceptives are
      acceptable, the best approach is probably to delay their use for at least 3
      months postpartum to allow lactation to become established and the infant to
      mature.

TI  - Cyclic nucleotides in breast milk.
PG  - 343-50
AB  - Adenosine 3':5' monophosphate3 (cAMP) and guanosine 3':5' monophosphate (cGMP)
      are known to participate in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation, 
      the processes intimately associated with maturation of the neonate. We have
      therefore examined their content in the physiological nutrient of the mammalian
      neonate, the mother's milk. Widely fluctuating concentrations between 0.1 and
      0.7, and between 0.01 and 0.15 nmol/ml, were found for cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP,
      respectively. Concentrations in human breast milk changed during the 5-to 15-min 
      period of one nursing, during any 24-h period, and also during the total
      lactation period. Levels of cyclic GMP were generally less fluctuating and were
      lower during afternoon and evening; they were relatively high at the start of
      lactation and levelled off during the postpartum period. The ratio of the two
      cyclic nucleotides also fluctuated widely and was significantly different from
      the ratio determined on blood plasma collected at the same time. Oxytocin
      injection had no effect on cyclic AMP content of rat milk. The stomach content of
      the nucleotide in rat pups remained high for at least 1 h after suckling
      indicating that cyclic nucleotides remain available for intestinal absorption;
      whether they have any physiological function in the neonate will have to emerge
      from further studies.

TI  - The role of breast-feeding in psychosexual development and the achievement of the
      genital phase.
PG  - 631-41
AB  - 1. The role of the neurohormone oxytocin is a physiological factor in the
      reproductive cycle of coitus, birth, breast-feeding, the milk-ejection reflex,
      nipple erotism, and female sexual responsiveness. 2. The capacity for
      "motherliness," the attributes of empathy, consideration, confidence, and love
      are dependent on the level of psychosexual, ego, and superego maturity of the
      mother as well as on the pattern of mothering she experienced as a child. 3. The 
      satisfaction of the oral hunger-satiation cycle is essential. Without it, even
      the most satisfactory maternal environment proves insufficient and results in
      serious ego constriction. 4. Bottle-feeding, as breast feeding, may offer a
      relatively satisfactory solution to the basic, physiological, hunger-satiation
      cycle and may fulfill, to a limited extent, the libidinal requirements of the
      crucial oral phase, depending on the psychosexual maturity and ego and superego
      development of the mother. 5. However, breast-feeding alone provides the
      experience of the original primal scene on which the later primal scene is based.
      6. The breast-feeding capacity in itself is no more an indication that
      psychosexual maturity and the genital phase have been achieved than is the
      ability to achieve vaginal orgasm (or genital orgasm, in the male). 7. Sherfey's 
      (1966) findings notwithstanding, Freud's (1925) statement that the elimination of
      clitoral primary (not participation) is essential for the development of
      femininity remains valid.

OAB - Aspects of the effect on the child's development of the experience of being
      breastfed are discussed. The neurohormone oxytocin is a factor in coitus, birth, 
      breastfeeding, the milk-ejection reflex, nipple erotism, and female sexual
      responsiveness. The attributes of empathy, consideration, confidence, and love
      that constitute the capacity of motherliness are dependent on the level of
      psychosexual, ego, and superego maturity of the mother as well as on the pattern 
      of mothering she experienced as a child. Without satisfaction of the oral
      hunger-satiation cycle, serious ego constriction results regardless of maternal
      environment. Bottle feeding may satisfy the basic physiological hunger-satiation 
      cycle and fulfill to some extent the libidinal requirements of the oral phase,
      but only breastfeeding can provide the experience of the original primal scene on
      which the later primal scene is based. Breastfeeding capacity in itself is not
      necessarily an indication however, that psychosexual maturity and the genital
      phase have been achieved by the mother.

PG  - 19-29
AB  - It is usual for women to ask for temporary control of fertility during the
      puerperium. When hormonal therapy is administered, the selection of the adequate 
      pill is very important. The effect of D-(-)-norgestrel 300mg was studied on
      uterine contractility values during puerperium is seven patients breast feeding
      and was compared with a control group of 26. The 33 patients had the following
      characteristics: multiparous during puerperium without recent episiotomy, with
      healthy cervix, absence of genital septic focus, uterine tumours or
      malformations; all of them breast feeding. In the hypothesis, it was considered
      that the endogenous oxytocin increases and stimulates the mammary mioepithelium
      and uterine contractilities. For recording uterine contractility, the technique
      of Jaumandreu and Hendricks was used. The recordings were made during 24 hours
      postpartum, and at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days with a duration 2 to 3 hours. All
      the studies were longitudinal. The changes of the human uterine contractility
      during normal puerperium were estimated. The range of the tonus was 22--41 mm Hg,
      the intensity 5--18 mm Hg, the frequency 17--23 contractions in 10 minutes, and
      the uterine activity 102--223 Montevideo Units. In the control group the
      following results were obtained: The range of the tonus was 24--34 mm Hg, the
      intensity 9--16 mm Hg, the frequency 17--37 contractions in 10 minutes, and the
      uterine contractility 137--524 Montevideo Units. In the comparative study
      Student's t test was used and p estimated.

TI  - Lactation suppression.
PG  - 1045-59
AB  - In spite of a very recent upsurge in breast-feeding in industrialized countries, 
      approximately one-half of parturients are candidates for postpartum lactation
      suppression. The mechanisms controlling lactation are complex and involve
      preparation of the breast during pregnancy, stimulation of secretion of milk in
      the immediate postpartum period, ejection of milk from the alveolar cells, and
      maintenance of milk production during the period od lactation. The local effects 
      of estrogen and progesterone in the breast prevent milk secretion during
      pregnancy. With their withdrawal in the postpartum period, the stimulating effect
      of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin dominates and milk secretion is
      initiated and maintained. Milk ejection is accomplished by a neurohormonal reflex
      resulting in stimulation of the myoepithelial cells of the breast by the
      posterior pituitary hormone oxytocin. Local stimulation of the breast by suckling
      is important in initiating the release of oxytocin and also the secretion of
      prolactin. The suppression of lactation in the postpartum period can be
      accomplished in approximately 60--70% of females by the use of a tight brassiere 
      and avoidance of stimulation of the nipples. An additional 10% or so of females
      can be helped with the use of estrogens during the postpartum period. The
      addition of an androgen to the estrogen increases the success rate of lactation
      suppression to about 90%. Unfortunately, the use of estrogen alone or in
      combination with an androgen is accompanied by rebound lactation in a significant
      number of patients and has been associated with an increased incidence of
      postpartum thromboembolic disease. Lactation suppression by inhibiting prolactin 
      secretion with synthetic ergot alkaloids such as bromocriptine has been shown to 
      be safe and highly effective both immediately post partum and after lactation has
      been established. The 2 week period of therapy required with this drug may be
      unsatisfactory for some patients. If given immediately at delivery, a single
      injection of testosterone enanthate and estradiol valerate is equally effective
      in suppressing lactation and, in the young patient who has delivered vaginally,
      is not associated with significant risk.

OAB - Newer aspects of the physiology of lactation are reviewed, and methods currently 
      available to the clinician for its suppression are examined. Despite a recent
      increase in breastfeeding in industrialized nations, about 1/2 of parturients are
      candidates for postpartum suppression. Mechanisms controlling lactation are
      complex, and they involve preparation of the breast during pregnancy, stimulation
      of secretion of milk in the immediate postpartum period, ejection of milk from
      the alveolar cells, and maintenance of milk production during the period of
      lactation. The local effects of estrogen and progesterone in the breast prevent
      the secretion of milk during pregnancy. With their withdrawal during the
      postpartum period, the stimulating effect of the anterior pituitary hormone
      prolactin dominates and milk secretion is initated as well as maintained. A
      neurohormonal reflex resulting in stimulation of the myoepithelial cells of the
      breast by the posterior pituitary hormone oxytocin is responsible for milk
      ejection. Local stimulation of the breast by suckling is important in initiating 
      the release of oxytocin as well as the secretion of prolactin. The use of a tight
      brassiere and avoidance of stimulation of the nipples can accomplish the
      suppression of lactation in the postpartum period in about 60-70% of females.
      Another 10% or so can be helped with the use of estrogens during the postpartum
      period. The addition of an androgen to the estrogen increases the success rate of
      lactation suppression to approximately 90%. The use of estrogen alone or in

      number of women and has been associated with an increased incidence of postpartum

AB  - The effect of nursing on plasma levels of oxytocin (OT), arginine vasopressin
      (AVP), and PRL was studied in six normal women 2-3 days post partum. Maternal
      blood samples were obtained for measurement of OT, AVP, PRL, sodium, and
      osmolality 3 and 0 min before suckling, at 3-min intervals for 15 min during
      suckling, and 5 min after completion of suckling. Plasma OT rose during suckling 
      from a mean (+/- SEM) baseline value of 1.1 +/- 0.2 to 3.6 +/- 0.6 microU/ml by 3
      min (P < 0.001), reached a peak level of 6.4 +/- 1.5 microU/ml by 6 min (P <
      0.005), and remained elevated for the entire 15-min period of suckling. Serial
      measurements of plasma OT during suckling failed to show a pattern consistent
      with episodic secretion. The baseline plasma AVP concentration was 0.4 +/- 0.1
      microU/ml and was not significantly altered by suckling. Plasma sodium and
      osmolality remained unchanged during the suckling period. The baseline serum PRL 
      level was 268 +/- 24 ng/ml and rose to 362 +/- 31 ng/ml after 15 min of suckling 
      (P < 0.05). The data suggest that suckling is a specific stimulus for OT and PRL 
      secretion but has no effect on AVP release.

      normal puerperium were estimated. The range of the tonus was 22--41 mmHg, the
      intensity 5--18 mmHg, the frequency 17--23 contractions in 10 minutes, and the
      uterine activity 102--223 Montevideo Units.

AB  - The patterns of response of oxytocin to a breast feed were studied in 10 mothers 
      in the first week post partum. The initiation of lactation did not appear to be
      related to release of oxytocin. In established lactation an oxytocin response did
      not appear to be essential for adequate milk flow and did not occur always at the
      time of peak milk flow. The only factor identified that positively correlated
      with release of oxytocin was multiparity. In those subjects who showed a response
      the hormone was released in surges, some of which persisted in the circulation
      for less than one minute. These findings cast some doubt on the conventional view
      that release of oxytocin is essential for satisfactory milk flow during
      breast-feeding.

OAB - 10 mothers comprised this study which measured the patterns of response of
      oxytocin during breeastfeeding. 6 mothers were studied in early lactation during 
      the 1st-3rd postpartum days and the remaining 4 mothers were studied in
      established lactation on days 5-7 postpartum. 3 basal blood samples (1.5 ml) were
      drawn over the course of 1 minute in the 15-minute period before a feeding. This 
      was done without the infant present in the room in order to avert the possible
      release of oxytocin due to mother-infant proximity. 3 more samples were drawn
      during the minute preceding sucking to assess anticipatory oxytocin release and
      additional samples were drawn over successive 20-second periods during a feed
      from the 1st breast. Oxytocin showed no response to feeding in 3 patients; no
      significant difference in total oxytocin response was seen when comparing those
      in early and those in established lactation. Multiparous mothers (N=6) did
      display a greater total oxytocin response than did primiparous mothers. In those 
      subjects who registered a response, oxytocin was released in surges which
      remained circulating in the system for less than 1 minute. Thus data indicate
      that oxytocin is not necessary for the successful injection of milk from the
      breast. Likewise, the timing of that hormone's release may not coincide with peak
      milk flow.

OAB - The incidence of mothers choosing to breastfeed their infants is on the upswing
      in the United Kingdom, according to this article, from a low point of 14% to the 
      level of the last decade, 60%. However, this article, which focuses on
      counselling of women so that they understand what are proper expectations in
      terms of lactational behavior, contends that a high proportion of women
      discontinue breastfeeding within the first 3 months; this discontinuation seems
      irrespective of parity but is greatest in social classes 4 and 5. Long-term
      success seems dependent on quantity of milk flow, a variable that with education 
      can be controlled to some degree in breastfeeding mothers. A study showed that
      80% of mothers with 30+ ml of milk on Day 3 of lactation continued whereas only
      about 40% did so if their milk quantity was 0-9 ml. The endocrinology of
      lactation, and the roles of prolactin and oxytocin in its successful rendering,
      is briefly outlined to provide midwives with arguments to encourage mothers to
      continue lactation behavior; for example, the fact that has been established that
      suckling every 2 hours raises milk yield is discussed in terms of prolactin
      initiation and secretion.

PG  - 111-5
AB  - Plasma bilirubin was estimated on 690 term infants on about the 6th day of life. 
      Perinatal factors were recorded and the results analysed. Hyperbilirubinaemia was
      defined as a level greater than 205 micromol/1 (12 mg/100 ml) and this was
      present in 20% of cases. Three factors--epidural analgesia, breast feeding, and
      poor weight recovery--showed highly significant associations with jaundice. The
      relative importance of these is discussed and compared with recent reports.
      Induction of labour, for reasons other than postmaturity, and a gestational age
      less than 39 weeks showed a slightly increased incidence of jaundice. There was
      no correlation with other factors tested including oxytocic drug administration. 
      Despite the high incidence (20%) of hyperbilirubinaemia, only 2.5% infants needed
      treatment and none required exchange transfusion. Radical changes in obstetric
      management or infant feeding are not indicated.

PG  - 227-39
AB  - A personal prospective study was made of some perinatal and postnatal problems
      associated with induction of labour by three different methods in primiparous
      women with unripe cervices. The methods of induction were: (A) amniotomy followed
      by intravenous oxytocin [49], (B) amniotomy followed by intravenous prostaglandin
      E2 [39], (C) prostaglandin E2 by the extra-amniotic route [42]. A spontaneous
      group (D) comprising 54 mother--infant pairs was also studied. Length of
      gestation was between 37 and 42 wk in all but 2 cases. There was no perinatal
      mortality, and no infant had hyaline membrane disease. A close association was
      found between method of delivery and method (or absence) or induction. The
      caesarean section rate was highest in group C and lowest in group D. The
      spontaneous vaginal delivery rate was lowest in group C and highest in group D.
      More infants in the three induction groups were admitted to the Special Care Baby
      Unit (SCBU) than in the spontaneous group. No significant associations were found
      between the severity of the conditions leading to induction and caesarean section
      rates, low Apgar scores, admissions to SCBU, or the favourability of the cervix
      before induction. Among those who intended to breast feed fewer infants in the
      spontaneous group changed from breast to bottle while in hospital and after
      discharge from hospital than in the combined induction groups. Success in
      breast-feeding was not significantly associated with method of delivery or
      whether the infant was admitted to SCBU or not.

OAB - The hormonal aspects of lactation are discussed with reference to findings from
      animal studies. Both lactation and the specific stimulus of suckling are
      physiological phenomena involving hormones from both the anterior and the
      posterior lobes of the pituitary gland. In women and animals, complex hormonal
      changes occur during gestation, some contributing to development of mammary
      tissue enabling it to synthesize milk. Progesterone and estrogens are present in 
      large amounts during pregnancy and reach peak levels near the end of pregnancy.
      Optimal breast development depends on other hormones also. Prolactin is the most 
      important hormone for the actual initiation of lactation postpartum. It is,
      however, the fall in estrogen and progesterone levels once the fetus and placenta
      are delivered which gives the final stimulus to lactation. Suckling stimulates
      the nerve ends in the nipple area of the breast, causing increased milk
      production. Suckling and the presence of prolactin probably account for the
      reduced fertility observed during the lactation period. Emotional problems will
      interfere with the milk ejection reflex. Additionally, combination
      estrogen/progestin OCs (oral contraceptives) cause a reduction in the quantity of
      milk produced.

TI  - Factors influencing jaundice in immigrant Greek infants.
PG  - 49-52
AB  - A study of 887 consecutively born immigrant Greek and 220 Anglo-Saxon Australian 
      infants has shown that serum bilirubin concentrations are influenced by these
      factors: breast feeding, delivery with forceps, gestation, birthweight, sex of
      the infant, presence of hypoxia, presence of blood group incompatibility, a
      positive direct Coombs's test, maternal sepis, and administration to the mother
      of promethazine hydrochloride, reserpine, chloral hydrate, barbiturates, narcotic
      agents, diazepam, oxytocin, aspirin, and phenytoin sodium. Apart from the
      administration of promethazine hydrochloride, reserpine, chloral hydrate, and
      quinalbarbitone sodium, only two factors, breast feeding and delivery by forceps,
      occured with different frequencies in the immigrant Greek and the Australian
      infants. Among the Greek infants with jaundice, there were few where the cause of
      the jaundice was inapparent. The immigrant Greek and Australian newborn
      populations were therefore remarkably similar. Since differences of frequency and
      severity of jaundice do exist in infants born in Greece, this difference must be 
      lost when the parents emigrate, and therefore an environmental factor must be
      incriminated as the causative agent for jaundice of unknown origin in Greece.

TI  - A multifactorial survey of neonatal juandice.
PG  - 452-5
AB  - Concern about a neonatal jaundice rate of 8-6 per cent prompted a retrospective
      survey of 981 full term infants. There was a highly significant association
      between increased oxytocin dosage and neonatal jaundice in induced labours. A
      significant association was also demonstrated between neonatal jaundice and both 
      breast-feeding and minor infections. No association was demonstrated between
      neonatal jaundice and the method of delivery of birth weight. The results of the 
      survey suggest that while oxytocin in high doses should be used with caution, the
      benefits obtained from the drug outweigh the risk of hyperbilirubinaemia which it
      may cause.

TI  - Changes in breast sensitivity at puberty, during the menstrual cycle, and at
      parturition.
PG  - 1188-91
AB  - Sensitivity to pain and touch was measured in the nipple, areola, and cutaneous
      breast tissue of prepubertal boys and girls, postpubertal men and nuliparous
      women before and after delivery. Before puberty there were no differences between
      the sexes, but after puberty the tactile sensitivity of all areas of the women's 
      breast was significantly greater than the men's. Tactil sensitivity of all areas 
      also varied during the menstrual cycle, with maximal sensitivity at midcycle and 
      at menstruation; the mid-cycle peak was absent when the women were taking oral
      contraceptives. But the most dramatic changes occured within 24 hours of
      parturition, when there was a great increase in breast sensitivity. This may be
      the key event for activating the suckling-induced discharge of oxytocin and
      prolactin and inhibiting ovulation during lactation.

TI  - [Hormonal regulation of lactation (author's transl)].
PG  - 385-95
AB  - Lactation is controlled by hormones from several endocrine glands. An undisturbed
      function of the anterior pituitary, of the adrenals, and of the ovaries is a
      prerequisite for a normal morphogenesis of the mammary gland. The epithelial
      ducts proliferative under the combined influence of estrogens, glucocorticoids
      and growth hormone, whereas the lobuloalveolar development depends on
      progesterone and prolactin in addition to the fore-mentioned hormones. During
      pregnancy pituitary prolactin may be substituted by placental lactogen. Milk
      synthesis begins in the second half of pregnancy. It is supported by prolactin
      and cortisol, which directly act on enzyme activities and processes of
      differentiation of the alveolar cells. The sudden surge in the secretion of milk 
      after parturition is most likely due to the rapid decline of the serum levels of 
      progesterone. The ejection of milk from the lactating mammary gland is controlled
      by a neuroendocrine reflex mechanism. Suckling is the appropriate stimulus for
      the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin increases
      intramammary pressure by inducing contraction of the myoepithelial cells and thus
      aids in expelling the milk from the mammary glands. Maintenance of normal
      postpartum lactation depends on frequent and intensive suckling. Suckling does
      not only stimulate the release of oxytocin, but also provokes secretion of
      prolactin and ACTH. This increase in prolactin caused by suckling guarantees
      galactopoesis. Influencing secretion of prolactin has been proven to be a useful 
      tool for regulating lactation. The experimental ergot derivative
      2-Brom-alpha-ergocryptine is a potent suppressor of prolactin secretion from the 
      anterior pituitary. In contrast to estrogens, alone or in combination with
      progestagens or androgens, this drug is not only effective in suppressing the
      onset of lactation, but also in inhibiting lactation once milk secretion had
      started. As to stimulating lactation in the human there is no effective drug
      available up to now.

TI  - The new mother's view of herself.
PG  - 145-57
AB  - A woman's attitude to breast-feeding is usually determined more by feeling than
      by rational thought; it is built on her adolescent views of the development of
      secondary sexual characteristics and subsequently on the breasts' part in sexual 
      attraction. Early in pregnancy a mother is aware that fixed advice is more often 
      offered than explanatory discussion. When birth is imminent, disinclination to
      breast-feed may be part of an unrecognized reluctance to submit to the changes
      which motherhood will bring. After the birth of her first child a mother finds
      herself enduring the discomforts of heightened moods and only too ready to
      interpret difficulties as signs of her inadequacy. Yet at the same time she is
      likely to discover her delight in her baby's repose and her own tranquillity at
      times of feeding.

AB  - Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is increasing in frequency. In view of conflicting
      evidence about the possible causes, retrospective analyses have been carried out 
      among babies born during six months of 1974. Preliminary analysis confirmed the
      over-riding importance of preterm birth (before 37 weeks), but only one of 17
      such cases could be attributed to ill-judged artificial induction of labor. For
      the main analysis, the incidence of eight possibly relevant antecedent factors
      was compared in 46 cases of hyperbilirubinaemia (unconjugated bilirubin more than
      15 mg per 100 ml in term babies and more than 13 mg per 100 ml in some preterm
      babies) and in 92 controls matched for sex and gestational age. Induction of
      labour by "primary" oxytocin infusion and artificial rupture of the membranes was
      very significantly more common in the index cases (p less than 0-01), but there
      was no difference in the incidence of "secondary" oxytocin, used to accelerate
      spontaneous labour. Evidence of uterin unresponsiveness suggests that the natural
      onset of labour was being anticipated by at least some days in many of the index 
      cases and this could prevent the natural "priming" of the fetal enzyme systems.
      An excess of epidural analgesia in the mothers of the index cases was probably
      due to its association with the need for pain relief during "primary" oxytocin
      infusions. The higher incidence of postnatal weight loss in the index cases
      presumably contributed to the hyperbilirubinaemia.

TI  - Pattern of sucking in the infant rat during spontaneous milk ejection.
PG  - 277-81
AB  - Two methods are described for measuring the sucking of rat pups on the nipples of
      the mother. The first uses pressure recording of the cannulated teatduct; the
      second uses direct observation of sucking behavior. Using these methods, the
      sucking behavior of the pups during sequences of milk ejections was investigated.
      Pressure recordings of the sucking of individual pups on the nipple showed that
      between milk ejections the pups sucked intermittently in bursts. During milk
      ejection itself there was a longer period of vigorous and continuous sucking.
      Behavioral observations on the level of sucking in whole litters of pups showed
      that the background bursts of sucking from the litter as a whole were randomly
      distributed in relation to the inferred time of oxytocin release. These results
      indicate that once the pups are sucking on the nipples, variations in the sucking
      behavior of the litter have no role in the timing of milk ejections in the
      mother.

TI  - Use of oxytocin and incidence of neonatal jaundice.
PG  - 116-8
AB  - A retrospective controlled study using data from the Cardiff Births Survey
      examined a possible relation between oxytocin administration to induce or
      accelerate labour and the subsequent development of neonatal jaundice. Among 10
      591 infants born in Cardiff between 1970 and 1972 the incidence of neonatal
      jaundice was higher in infants born after oxytocin administration than among
      others. Analysis by gestational age at delivery, birth weight, Apgar score,
      length of labour, sedative and analgesic therapy during labour, and suppression
      of lactation showed that this association held within all these categories except
      among small immature infants, who are at high risk of jaundice in any case.

TI  - Vaginally administered prostaglandin E2 as a first and second trimester

PG  - 43-6
AB  - One hundred women seeking interruption of pregnancy between 7-20 weeks were given
      prostaglandin E2 as a 20 mg vaginal suppository every four hours. Abortion was
      achieved within an arbitrary time limit of 36 hours in 97 patients and was
      complete in 76. Mean abortion intervals according to gestational length and
      parity ranged between 7.67 and 14.93 hours. Augmentive intravenous oxytocin,
      usually for placental expulsion, was given to 31 patients. Side-effects such as
      vomiting, diarrhea, and drug fever were encountered in the majority of patients
      but no sepsis was noted and no patient was transfused. The results are discussed 
      with particular reference to other prostaglandin and hypertonic saline regimens
      for pregnancy interruption.

OAB - A series of 100 consecutive patients seeking pregnancy termination in pregnancy
      weeks 7-20 were treated with a schedule of 20-mg vaginal suppositories containing
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2); the schedule was being tested for its efficacy,
      specifically reduction of total dose and related side effects. 94 of the 100
      patients were aborted within an arbitrary time span of 36 hours. Total drug dose 
      ranged from 40-160 mg. 31 patients received augmentative intravenous oxytocin.
      Induction-abortion interval varied from 6-32.5 hours. Of the 97 successes, 76
      were classified as complete abortions. No significant differences were noted in
      midtrimester groups based on increasing parity, although parous patients in
      gestation week 13-15 seemed to have the best results, based on average interval
      time. No sepsis or need for transfusion was encountered. Side effects were emesis
      (n-75), diarrhea (n=17), and drug fever (n=66); less frequent side effects
      included headache, breast tenderness, and vasomotor symptoms (n=13, 1, and 1,
      respectively). The midtrimester patient results compared favorably with results
      of studies using saline for abortifacient. The number of first trimester patients
      was too small to yield any conclusion.

OAB - The higher incidence of fetal, neonatal, and maternal deaths in the U.S. than in 
      other developed countries is due to the unphysiological practices adopted during 
      childbirth and the lack of emotional support offered to mothers in labor.
      American mothers must be educated to a ccept a certain amount of inconvenience
      and discomfort in order to have a delivery more conducive to the good health of
      themselves and their babies. These supportive efforts are known to reduce the
      need for obstetrical medication and obstetrical intervention during labor and
      birth. It is not necessary that normal childbirth be performed in hospitals with 
      physicians; nurse midwives can provide much of the predelivery support and care. 
      Medication during labor and delivery increases the risks to both mother and
      child. Breast feeding must be actively encouraged in order to reduce the
      incidence of infant mortality and to offer emotional support for the postpartum
      mother. Other U.S. obstetrical practices which warp the childbirth experience in 
      this country include elective induction of labor, separation of the mother from
      her family during delivery and the immediate postpartum period, and chemical
      stimulation of labor.

OAB - Tubal motility during the menstrual cycle was measured in women by means of an
      indwelling polyvinyl catheter. During all phases of the cycle, there were
      episodes of tubal motility at regular intervals. These episodes were more
      frequent during menstruation but the intensity and duration were greater during
      the proliferative phase. During the luteal phase the intensity and duration of
      the outburst were depressed. The episodes of motor activity were asynchronous
      between the 2 tubes and between different portions of the same tube. Activity in 
      the rabbit was similar to that of the human and was found in the isthmic and
      ampullar portions of the tube but not in the infundibulum. Intravenous
      administration of epinephrine or norepinephrine increased motility.
      Alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine mesylate and phenoxybenzamine
      suppressed spontaneous outbursts in the rabbit. The tubes were sensitive to
      oxytocin but almost insensitive to vasopressin. Suction of the breast increased
      tubal motility.

TI  - A study of the parameters of electrical stimulation of unmyelinated fibres in the
      pituitary stalk.
PG  - 67-81
AB  - 1. The milk-ejection response in lactating rabbits has been used to study the
      effect of electrical stimuli of different types applied to the
      supraopticohypophysial tract in the pituitary stalk.2. Sine-wave
      alternating-current pulses were compared with balanced biphasic square-wave
      pulses of the same frequency and peak-to-peak current strength. At a pulse
      duration of 2-4 msec the square-wave stimulation was less effective than the sine
      wave, but at a pulse duration of 8 msec and over, more effective.3. Above
      threshold levels of 0.12 mA for the current strength, and of 0.5 msec for the
      pulse duration, the response increased with increasing current strengths to 2.4
      mA and increasing pulse durations to 10 msec.4. With constant and effective
      strength and duration of the pulse a slight diminution of the response was seen
      as the frequency was diminished from 100/sec to 50/sec. Further diminution in the
      frequency revealed that at some point between 50 and 10 c/s a sudden abrupt
      diminution in the magnitude of the responses occurred over a small range of
      frequency. This was a reversible phenomenon and it is suggested that it may be
      related to neurosecretory events occurring in the nerve terminals.5. Stimuli with
      parameters within the ranges mentioned above are effective in eliciting an
      oxytocic response on the uterus in the rabbit and ovulation responses (when
      applied to the hypothalamus) in rats and rabbits. It appears likely that stimuli 
      with such parameters are suitable for experiments concerned with stimulation of
      the hypothalamus.

OAB - Lactation is a psychological phenomenon. This is indicated by the fact that
      breastfeeding has declined so rapidly in recent years in western countries.
      Successful breastfeeding depends on maternal factors, infant response to
      breastfeeding, and various psychophysiological factors, which are, in turn,
      affected by the maternal and infant variables. Studies have shown generally that 
      women who have more positive or stronger maternal attitudes and those who had
      more positive obstetric experiences are more likely to breastfeed. They are also 
      more likely to succeed and to continue with breastfeeding. Women who respond
      sexually to the process of breastfeeding are more likely to succeed with it.
      Women are more likely to breastfeed if attitudes in the general society are
      favorable to it. 2 psychosomatic mechanisms--the milk-ejection reflex and the
      suckling stimulation--are discussed in relation to the success of the lactation
      process. Through these mechanisms, the previously discussed psychological factors
      may affect the actual production of milk.

TI  - Assay of oxytocin by rat mammary gland in vitro.
PG  - 136-41
AB  - A new method for quantitative assay of oxytocin using strips from rat mammary
      gland in vitro has been investigated. The method is very suitable for
      determination of small amounts of oxytocin. Doses down to 2 mu-u. oxytocin have
      been estimated. The dose-response curve is shown to be linear, and the precision 
      of the method is good (lambda =0.10 to 0.14). The effect of adrenaline,
      noradrenaline, acetylcholine, histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine on the rat
      mammary gland has also been tested.

TI  - Release of oxytocin in unanaesthetized lactating rats.
PG  - 297-304
AB  - The action of certain substances on the release of oxytocin has been studied in
      unanaesthetized lactating rats. The release of oxytocin has been assessed by the 
      increase in weight after suckling of rats separated overnight from the mother. A 
      large variety of substances appear to block the release of oxytocin. These
      include pentolinium, atropine and chlorpromazine. Adrenaline and noradrenaline
      also cause a block in the release of oxytocin, and it is suggested that
      adrenaline blocks the central release of oxytocin as well as blocking its
      peripheral action. Reserpine and oestradiol in the doses administered did not
      block the release of oxytocin. Block also occurred after the ingestion of water, 
      ethanol and normal saline, an effect which may be produced indirectly by impulses
      from the gastro-intestinal tract.

TI  - MILK LET-DOWN-The Use of Intranasal Oxytocin for Nursing Mothers.
PG  - 168-9
AB  - A study was carried out to determine whether intranasal spraying with a solution 
      of oxytocin was an effective way to increase flow of milk in mothers who wished
      to breast-feed their babies.A hundred such women were given the drug
      intramuscularly for two days before they were to begin nursing. Then
      administration by that means was discontinued and 50 of the hundred were given
      oxytocin nasal spray kits for use at home. In general the patients receiving the 
      spray kits were those who were apprehensive about sufficient lactation, those who
      had had previous difficulty and those who had flat, inverted or tender nipples.
      Results were not much different between the 50 women who used the spray and the
      50 controls, but since the former group included the "difficult" cases, some
      benefit may be attributed to the aerosol therapy. Ninety per cent of those who
      used it said they would be willing to use it again.
