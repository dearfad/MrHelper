AB  - Depression is accompanied by an array of neurobiological variations, including
      altered HPA axis activity, monoamine, growth factor and inflammatory immune
      functioning. In addition, a recent perspective has entertained the possible role 
      for oxytocin in depressive disorders. Given the involvement of oxytocin in
      prosocial behaviors such as attachment, affiliation, trust, and social support
      seeking, it is not surprising this neuropeptide might be involved in the
      development or maintenance of depressive disorders. This view is supported by
      evidence that oxytocin interacts with various neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter,
      and inflammatory processes that have previously been implicated in depression.
      Thus, it might be profitable to consider the contribution of oxytocin in the
      context of several neurobiological changes provoked by stressors. The current
      review examines the relation between oxytocin and depression with a specific
      focus on the interactions between the oxytocinergic system and stressor-provoked 
      biological and psychosocial responses. The possibility is also considered that
      oxytocin might increase the salience of social cues, such that positive or
      negative experiences result in exaggerated responses that may influence affective
      states.

TI  - Plasma oxytocin concentrations following MDMA or intranasal oxytocin in humans.

AB  - MDMA (+/-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 'ecstasy') is reportedly used
      recreationally because it increases feelings of sociability and interpersonal
      closeness. Prior work suggests that the pro-social effects of MDMA may be
      mediated by release of oxytocin. A direct examination of plasma levels of
      oxytocin after acute doses of oxytocin and MDMA, in the same individuals, would
      provide further evidence for the idea that MDMA produces its pro-social effects
      by increasing oxytocin. Fourteen healthy MDMA users participated in a 4-session, 
      double-blind study in which they received oral MDMA (0.75 and 1.5mg/kg),
      intranasal oxytocin (20IU or 40IU), and placebo. Plasma oxytocin concentrations, 
      as well as cardiovascular and subjective effects were assessed before and at
      several time points after drug administration. MDMA (1.5mg/kg only) increased
      plasma oxytocin levels to a mean peak of 83.7pg/ml at approximately 90-120min,
      compared to 18.6pg/ml after placebo. Intranasal oxytocin (40IU, but not 20IU)
      increased plasma oxytocin levels to 48.0pg/ml, 30-60min after nasal spray
      administration. MDMA dose-dependently increased heart rate, blood pressure,
      feelings of euphoria (e.g., 'High' and 'Like Drug'), and feelings of sociability,
      whereas oxytocin had no cardiovascular or subjective effects. The subjective and 
      cardiovascular responses to MDMA were not related to plasma oxytocin levels,
      although the N was small for this analysis. Future studies examining the effects 
      of oxytocin antagonists on responses to MDMA will help to determine the mechanism
      by which MDMA produces pro-social effects.
