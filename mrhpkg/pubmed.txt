TI  - Cervical Ripening Using Foley Balloon with or without Oxytocin: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.1055/s-0038-1668577 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess available evidence regarding the use of oxytocin in
      conjunction with Foley balloon (FB) for cervical ripening. METHODS: Databases
      from MEDLINE (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 1980-May 12, 2017), MEDLINE
      (Ovid, 1980-June 30, 2017), the Cochrane Library Controlled Trials Register,
      ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science were queried for studies on FB cervical
      ripening with or without oxytocin in pregnant women. Search terms included:
      "balloon dilatation" OR "mechanical methods" OR "mechanical method" OR
      "mechanical dilation" OR "mechanical dilatation" OR "mechanical dilations" OR
      "mechanical dilatations" OR "balloon" OR "Foley" AND "Pitocin" OR "oxytocin." All
      relevant references were reviewed. Literature for inclusion and methodological
      quality were reviewed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
      Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. RESULTS: Out of 344 citations, six
      randomized clinical trials (1,133 patients) fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The
      pooled estimate showed that the cesarean delivery (CD) rate did not differ
      (relative risk [RR]: 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.76-1.10]; p = 0.23)
      between patients who underwent preinduction cervical ripening with FB alone
      versus those who received oxytocin in addition to FB. Heterogeneity was not
      significant among studies (I(2) 0.0%; p = 0.64). Furthermore, no differences in
      other outcomes such as composite and maternal outcomes were detected between
      these two groups. Compared with simultaneous use of oxytocin with FB, the Foley
      alone cervical ripening group had a longer induction to delivery time, and lower 
      deliveries within 12 and 24 hours. Subgroup analysis showed that only multiparous
      women in the Foley alone group had lower rate of vaginal delivery within 24 hours
      (RR: 0.74, 95% CI [0.61-0.89], p = 0.002) along with a trend toward higher CD
      rates. CONCLUSION: Adding oxytocin to FB at the time of preinduction cervical
      ripening does not reduce cesarean rates nor improve maternal or neonatal
      outcomes. Multiparous women who received FB alone seem to have lower rates of
      vaginal deliveries within 24 hours, but these results should be interpreted with 
      caution.

TI  - Peptidergic nature of nociception-related projections from the hypothalamic
      paraventricular nucleus to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

AB  - Hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) projections to the spinal dorsal horn 
      (SDH) are related to antinociception. Several neuropeptides from this nucleus
      could be released to the spinal cord after nociceptive stimuli. Indeed, it has
      been shown that enkephalins, oxytocin and vasopressin could be released at this
      level. Although the antinociceptive effects of these neuropeptides are well
      studied, little is known about the potential interaction between these molecules.
      In this study, we provide anatomical evidence of the interaction between oxytocin
      (OT), vasopressin (AVP), dynorphin (DYN) and enkephalin (ENK) along the PVN
      projections to the spinal dorsal horn at L3 level. A retrograde tracer (True
      Blue((R))) microinjected at L3 in the SDH and immunofluorescence with antibodies 
      against OT, AVP, DYN and ENK were used. The experiments showed different levels
      of peptide immunoreactivity distribution along the rostro-caudal area of the PVN.
      A high percentage of co-localizations between two of the peptides (OT-AVP,
      OT-DYN, AVP-ENK, DYN-ENK) were present along the PVN. The following
      co-localizations occupied 4.76-9.62% of the total PVN area. PVN projections to
      the SDH at L3 level showed similar results. Our results show that different
      antinociceptive peptides may be interacting with each other to evoke PVN
      antinociceptive effects as part of the endogenous system of nociceptive
      modulation.
