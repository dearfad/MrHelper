This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues. Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues: Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have. [source: Atom ] Need more inspiration? [1] Read the Docs [2] Django (scroll down to \"Guidelines\" as well) Bonus points: Add a link to a resource for people who have never contributed to open source before. \u00b6 Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/ Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub . [source: React ] As a side note, it helps to use newcomer-friendly language throughout the rest of your document. Here are a couple of examples from Active Admin : At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first If a maintainer asks you to \"rebase\" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge. Getting started \u00b6 Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution. \u00b6 How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include: Let them know if they need to sign a CLA, agree to a DCO, or get any other legal stuff out of the way If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain how to run the tests If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or Trac), let them know which tools they\u2019ll need to contribute For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix: Create your own fork of the code Do the changes in your fork If you like the change and think the project could use it: Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation. Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct. Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file. [source: Requirejs ] Need more inspiration? [1] Active Admin [2] Node.js [3] Ember.js If you have a different process for small or \"obvious\" fixes, let them know. \u00b6 Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA. As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following: * Spelling / grammar fixes * Typo correction, white space and formatting changes * Comment clean up * Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants * Adding logging messages or debugging output * Changes to \u2018metadata\u2019 files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc. * Moving source files from one directory or package to another [source: Chef ] Need more inspiration? [1] Puppet How to report a bug \u00b6 Explain security disclosures first! \u00b6 At bare minimum, include this sentence: If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead. If you don\u2019t want to use your personal contact information, set up a \u201csecurity@\u201d email address. Larger projects might have more formal processes for disclosing security, including encrypted communication. (Disclosure: I am not a security expert.) Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@travis-ci.org In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions: * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to? * Can I disable something for other people? If the answer to either of those two questions are \"yes\", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer \"no\" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org . [source: Travis CI ] Need more inspiration? [1] Celery [2] Express.js Tell your contributors how to file a bug report. \u00b6 You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you). When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions: What version of Go are you using (go version)? What operating system and processor architecture are you using? What did you do? What did you expect to see? What did you see instead? General questions should go to the golang-nuts mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug. [source: Go ] Need more inspiration? [1] Celery [2] Atom (includes template) How to suggest a feature or enhancement \u00b6 If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here. \u00b6 This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project\u2019s needs. The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs. Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework. [source: Express ] Need more inspiration? Active Admin Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature. \u00b6 If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it\u2019s needed and how it might work. If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. [source: Elasticsearch ] Need more inspiration? [1] Hoodie [2] Ember.js Code review process \u00b6 Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it\u2019s been submitted. \u00b6 Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it\u2019s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all? The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the puppet-dev list. Notes are posted to the Puppet Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity. [source: Puppet ] Need more inspiration?

Larger projects might have more formal processes for disclosing security, including encrypted communication. (Disclosure: I am not a security expert.) Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@travis-ci.org In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions: * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to? * Can I disable something for other people? If the answer to either of those two questions are \"yes\", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer \"no\" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org .

The publisher's city may be presented without the state, which must be typed in manually after importing if desired. Sometimes, even the city must be gleaned from the Notes field. 3. Certain author names must be edited after importing. The name \"OBryen\" for example will import as \"Obryen\" (note lower-case second letter). Since the apostrophe wasn't supplied in the first place, one must provide it manually, thus \"O'Bryen\". 4. Patent application and publication dates are presented with extraneous information, which must be deleted after importing. In addtion, the year must be moved from the Patent Date field to the Year field manually. 5. If you are using EndNote 8, the language code for patents is imported into the Language field. In earlier versions, it is imported into the Patent Date field along with the pages; both pages and language code must be manually moved to their appropriate fields after importing. (If you have EndNote 7 or earlier, you may edit this filter, changing the 'Language' to 'Notes' in the PD tag of the Patent template.) 6. If you are using direct export and depending on which database you downloaded patents from, the issue date may in fact be the issue number of the journal in which the patent was published.
